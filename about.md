The Public Office is a long-term development project initiated by Dilettant AB. The project aims to articulate an idea of open and rent-free work and meeting places, where citizens are given the opportunity to engage in work and further education. The foundation of the idea is the creation of free and democratically available structures for work, where people's time and competences can be shared and enrich each other.   

The concept of public offices is an infrastructural proposal and a political vision that seeks to meet the changing needs of the labor markets, characterized by an increased mobility and flexibility in the work. During several project phases, we intend to explore the concept's possibilities and potential functions in an increasingly mobile labor market, as well as in urban planning and local development, business development and integration.  

In this section you can read more about the project and its phases, collaborators and funders, as well as some basic ideological principles upon which the project rests. To go deeper into the research work, visit the [Concept pages] (concept.html).
