intro: The Public Office is a long-term development project initiated by Dilettant AB (svb)
---

The Public Office starts from the view that threes a need for more public spaces where people in a neighborhood can gather and be active together, or next to each other – meet and get contacts over boarders of generation, occupation, social situation and background. This could be people who are studying or working in their homes or in cafés, who are engaging in (or want to engage in) cultural, non-profit, and social projects and organizations. People who are looking for a context to develop ideas, discuss, do family research or crosswords – who simply would enjoy spaces to experience communality. 

In this section you can read more about the project and its phases, collaborators and funders, as well as some basic ideological principles upon which the project rests. To go deeper into the research work, visit the [Concept pages](concept.html).
