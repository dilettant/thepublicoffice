subtitle: "At the swedish museum of architecture<br>30 oct - 30 nov, 2012"
description: "The Public Office is a long-term development project that seeks to articulate an idea of open and rent-free work and meeting places, where the public is given the opportunity to engage in work and further education. During several project phases, we explore the conceptâ€™s possibilities and potential functions in an increasingly mobile labor market, as well as in urban planning and local community development, business development and integration."
