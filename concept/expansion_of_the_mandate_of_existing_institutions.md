Since many aspirations and approaches regarding The Public Office coincide with public libraries, there is reason to inquire into possibilities of incorporating The Public Office in the library structure. To some extent, libraries are already offering places to work and study. However, we believe that The Public Office needs a greater volume and a specific architecture and structure to provide an effective public workplace.

According to this proposal, the public libraries would be granted an extended mandate; to house Public Offices adjacent to the existing library spaces. In practical terms, this could mean that libraries receive support to expand or develop their facilities and operations. Existing structures for library cards, internet access and user information administration can also be used by The Public Office.
	
It is also possible to envision The Public Office being housed in other types of public cultural institutions; culture centres, performing arts venues, museums and so on. Public cultural institutions, especially the ones devoted to the performing arts, tend to have big surfaces, such as foyers, used only at certain times of the day, which could be activated to a much greater extent.
