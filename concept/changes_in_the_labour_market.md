The contemporary labour markets are changing, and today there are obvious trends towards a growing proportion of freelance workers, short-term employees and one-person firms. Individuals and businesses are more geographically mobile than ever before, and with new communication technologies, work can be done at any time and from anywhere.
	
As a result of this, work is increasingly carried out from homes, cafes, libraries and so on. This "workplacelessness" means that many people today lack access to the community, stability and skills development of a workplace (1). This situation calls for new types of political analyses and initiatives.
	
In many industries, long-term employment is a distant memory, and there are significant differences in the securities and benefits between the employee and the entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs are cherished in the political discourse, but there are few substantial efforts to improve the precarious situation that it implies to "do-it-yourself”.
	
The increased amount of small businesses and freelancers can at best lead to a greater variety of activities and at worst a negative competition that has implications for both quality, working environment and social security.
	
Running your own business or working freelance, with the flexibility and mobility that it can imply, is for many people a desirable situation. This work situation is often characterized by a strong commitment and a great possibility to influence how, when and where the work is conducted. At the same time, this freedom can lead to more complicated and precarious aspects such as uncertainty regarding future ventures and income, the feeling of always having to be available, more time spent on administration and budgeting, and a precarious existence in relation to the social support structures.
	
In this context, we believe that The Public Office has great potential to be stabilizing, strengthening, and productive in numerous respects. For many people, having a workplace would also make it easier to separate work from personal life; to be able to go to – and leave – a workplace, can contribute to better concentration and efficiency. Another important aspect, is that The Public Office can provide a common context for people who often feel that they must do everything themselves. There is considerable knowledge and information that is currently lost, that "escapes", in that there is no functioning forum for sharing.
	
Belonging to a community could be understood as essential for constructing an image of oneself as capable of influencing ones own situation and a larger context. Many freelancers admit to a sense of lack of belonging, and a difficulty in establishing oneself in new environments. This is especially valid for graduates, job seekers, people who have recently arrived in a new country or city, or who for other reasons lack access to relevant networks.
	
Working side by side, without necessarily working on the same project, is a good way to build skills, exchange information and access feedback, advice and support. In a time when most professionals spend much of their time behind a computer and in digital environments, it is important to stress the significance of a spatial community; to take a break together with others, to discuss current issues as well as business and project ideas.

(1) It is difficult to say exactly how widespread the "workplacelessness" is, and according to Statistics Sweden (Statistiska Centralbyrån) and the Work Environment Authority (Arbetsmiljöverket), there are no current statistics on the issue.
