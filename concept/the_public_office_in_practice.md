A Public Office is an open and rent-free work and meeting place in which citizens have the opportunity to engage in work and further education.
	
The foundation of The Public Office consists of an open workplace with free access to the internet, electricity, and basic office equipment. Separate meeting rooms and computers on loan can be reserved free of charge. The Public Office can be used for regular or temporary work.
	
The Public Offices may have one or more employees, who welcomes and introduces users to the site and its functions.
	
Print, copy, phone and fax, as well as access to lockers, mobile drawer units or storage spaces can be provided as 'Pay-Per-Use' services. 
	
In direct connection to The Public Office there should be a staffed cafe where the user can pause, socialize and make connections. The cafe can be run in cooperation with existing local cafes, bakeries and so on.
	
Opening hours are proposed to be 8:00 to 22:00 on weekdays and 10:00 to 18:00 on weekends.
