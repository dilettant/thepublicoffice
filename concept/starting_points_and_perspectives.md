The vision of Public Offices is derived from observations and analyses of the contemporary labor market, characterized by increasing flexibility, mobility, and precarity. Starting from the notion of "workplacelessness", it addresses the role of, and right to, workplace communality and democratic access to work and cooperative knowledge production. Further, the idea is situated in issues of local urban development, where we propose that public meeting places for knowledge sharing through work can play a key role in local sustainable development. In this section we address and develop these starting points and perspectives. 

## changes in the labour market {#changes_in_the_labour_market}

The contemporary labour markets are changing, and today there are obvious trends towards a growing proportion of freelance workers, short-term employees and one-person firms. Individuals and businesses are more geographically mobile than ever before, and with new communication technologies, work can be done at any time and from anywhere.
  
As a result of this, work is increasingly carried out from homes, cafes, libraries and so on. This "workplacelessness" means that many people today lack access to the community, stability and skills development of a workplace [(1)](#footnotes){#foot1}. This situation calls for new types of political analyses and initiatives.
  
In many industries, long-term employment is a distant memory, and there are significant differences in the securities and benefits between the employee and the entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs are cherished in the political discourse, but there are few substantial efforts to improve the precarious situation that it implies to "do-it-yourself”.
  
The increased amount of small businesses and freelancers can at best lead to a greater variety of activities and at worst a negative competition that has implications for both quality, working environment and social security.
  
Running your own business or working freelance, with the flexibility and mobility that it can imply, is for many people a desirable situation. This work situation is often characterized by a strong commitment and a great possibility to influence how, when and where the work is conducted. At the same time, this freedom can lead to more complicated and precarious aspects such as uncertainty regarding future ventures and income, the feeling of always having to be available, more time spent on administration and budgeting, and a precarious existence in relation to the social support structures.
  
In this context, we believe that The Public Office has great potential to be stabilizing, strengthening, and productive in numerous respects. For many people, having a workplace would also make it easier to separate work from personal life; to be able to go to – and leave – a workplace, can contribute to better concentration and efficiency. Another important aspect, is that The Public Office can provide a common context for people who often feel that they must do everything themselves. There is considerable knowledge and information that is currently lost, that "escapes", in that there is no functioning forum for sharing.
  
Belonging to a community could be understood as essential for constructing an image of oneself as capable of influencing ones own situation and a larger context. Many freelancers admit to a sense of lack of belonging, and a difficulty in establishing oneself in new environments. This is especially valid for graduates, job seekers, people who have recently arrived in a new country or city, or who for other reasons lack access to relevant networks.
  
Working side by side, without necessarily working on the same project, is a good way to build skills, exchange information and access feedback, advice and support. In a time when most professionals spend much of their time behind a computer and in digital environments, it is important to stress the significance of a spatial community; to take a break together with others, to discuss current issues as well as business and project ideas.


## public meeting places and the right to work {#public_meeting_places_and_the_right_to_work}

In the contemporary welfare state, public spaces are provided, protected or subsidized – spaces where people can meet, sit down, take a walk, engage in educational and cultural activities etc. – without requiring a financial transaction in a direct sense. These spaces and places form an infrastructure that promotes equal opportunities for knowledge, culture, leisure and mobility.

Public places have the potential, through their availability, to create environments where a variety of people can feel welcome. The idea of The Public Office suggests that the opportunities provided to citizens through The Right of Public Access, public schools, libraries, cultural centres etc., should also cover the spatial and physical aspects of people's working lives, given the development of labour markets and changes in the forms of work outlined above. In this situation, it is relevant to apply formulations of equal rights to work and fair working conditions:

> "The right to work is not an unconditional right to a job, but an obligation on states to take measures designed to eliminate unemployment. Everyone has the right to just and favourable conditions of work, including remuneration that is reasonable and sufficient to provide families with an existence worthy of human dignity, and to equal pay for equal work. In addition, everyone should have secure and healthy working conditions and opportunities for promotion."* [(2)](#footnotes){#foot2}

## public meeting places in local development {#public_meeting_places_in_local_development}

Many cities and municipalities have realized the need for different types of forums and meeting places, a need that is created in part by the increased mobility of people and businesses. Many municipalities are actively working to identify and develop strategies to create different types of contemporary meeting places. These venues are considered by many to be crucial for developing the local environment and make it more attractive. [(3)](#footnotes){#foot3} 
  
The ability to work in close proximity to one's home could be an argument for city districts and municipalities that want to develop local participation and increase the quality for residents. In the longer term, Public Offices could thereby help to reduce the currently increasing commuting-time, thus reducing environmental impact.
  
The urban environment requires different types of milieus that create conditions for meetings and social interaction. Since the working life of many people today is characterized by social interaction and professional networking, it seems relevant to develop accessible, social meeting places for work. Thus The Public Office could assist people and businesses that are new to a city or city district, to more quickly find community and build connections.
  
Many municipalities and city districts are working hard to attract businesses and companies to establish themselves. A structure of Public Offices is in this respect, based on the use of the flows and activities that already exist. In many neighbourhoods, there are large numbers of entrepreneurs, businesses, cultural workers, NGOs and activities that are not visible, because the work is carried out in homes or in cafes. Local Public Offices would provide a framework that can be filled by existing local businesses, which in turn would stimulate the local environment by becoming visible, by coming together, and by interacting. The Public Office thus has the potential of functioning as a catalyst for opportunities for collaboration and innovation amongst a shared community setting.
