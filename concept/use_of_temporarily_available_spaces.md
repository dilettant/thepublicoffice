The Public Office can be housed in spaces that are empty for a period of time. In many cities there are sites of various size and function that remain unused for a number of years, awaiting a new tenant, renovation or political decision.
	
This strategy, using the unused spaces, holds great potential especially in terms of using existing resources and activating sites that might otherwise spread a sense of desolation and decay. This strategy proposes that temporary initiatives have positive and long-term impacts on a neighborhood and its inhabitants.
	
Some unused sites would probably need renovation in order to accommodate a public workplace, but the solution as a whole should be beneficial for the users, property owners and local communities. We therefore consider the proposal of accommodating The Public Office in temporarily unused spaces to be promising for a wide range of stakeholders to invest in.
