The Public Office would make positive impacts on businesses, as "scattered" competencies and energies can connect, interact and be shared. There are many contexts in which individuals alone perform tasks that would benefit from being organized cooperatively, or depend on personal contacts with people who have the know-how for example regarding information about taxes, budgeting, employer liability, billing, procedures when applying for business development support and cultural support, searching for relevant business contacts and so on. When people with different skills work in the same space, these support processes are helped considerably. Furthermore, The Public Office is expected to constitute a creative and heterogeneous environment that should be able to produce added value for local businesses as well as increasing knowledge levels regarding entrepreneurship.
