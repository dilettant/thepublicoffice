As a political issue, we believe that The Public Office primarily covers the following policy areas: labour, culture, business and education. In this section we develop ideas on how and why these areas can and should engage in the vision of Public Offices.

## Labour {#labour}

The Public Office has great potential to become a concrete initiative towards job creation and networking, as well as for professional learning and skills development. As the opportunities to work are increasingly dependent on social structures and informal networks, the Public Offices – forming an infrastructure of public workplaces – is an effort to democratize opportunities for work. As a public workplace, The Public Office also has the opportunity to become part of greater integration support initiatives and processes.

## Culture {#culture}

It is a generally accepted political description that members of the arts, culture and the creative industries produce important values – economic as well as social and cultural –, constituting a cornerstone in the descriptions of knowledge and creativity as future markets [(1)](#footnotes){#foot1}. However, there are political inconsistencies in how this thesis operates in practice, since few substantial – in relation to the magnitude of the matter – political actions are made to strengthen the "creative core" of the creative industries theories, i.e. the artists and cultural workers. The Public Office would be a tangible and productive effort to strengthen the working conditions and development opportunities of artists and cultural entrepreneurs.

## Business {#business}

The Public Office would make positive impacts on businesses, as "scattered" competencies and energies can connect, interact and be shared. There are many contexts in which individuals alone perform tasks that would benefit from being organized cooperatively, or depend on personal contacts with people who have the know-how for example regarding information about taxes, budgeting, employer liability, billing, procedures when applying for business development support and cultural support, searching for relevant business contacts and so on. When people with different skills work in the same space, these support processes are helped considerably. Furthermore, The Public Office is expected to constitute a creative and heterogeneous environment that should be able to produce added value for local businesses as well as increasing knowledge levels regarding entrepreneurship.

## Education {#education}

One of the fundamental ideas of The Public Office is to enable cooperative knowledge processes. We don't primarily expect that all users will collaborate and spontaneously co-organize different events, but co-working with other people in a work community permits an organic professional development in terms of human resources and proximity to other knowledge, experiences and networks.
