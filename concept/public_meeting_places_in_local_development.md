Many cities and municipalities have realized the need for different types of forums and meeting places, a need that is created in part by the increased mobility of people and businesses. Many municipalities are actively working to identify and develop strategies to create different types of contemporary meeting places. These venues are considered by many to be crucial for developing the local environment and make it more attractive.(3) 
	
The ability to work in close proximity to one's home could be an argument for city districts and municipalities that want to develop local participation and increase the quality for residents. In the longer term, Public Offices could thereby help to reduce the currently increasing commuting-time, thus reducing environmental impact.
	
The urban environment requires different types of milieus that create conditions for meetings and social interaction. Since the working life of many people today is characterized by social interaction and professional networking, it seems relevant to develop accessible, social meeting places for work. Thus The Public Office could assist people and businesses that are new to a city or city district, to more quickly find community and build connections.
	
Many municipalities and city districts are working hard to attract businesses and companies to establish themselves. A structure of Public Offices is in this respect, based on the use of the flows and activities that already exist. In many neighbourhoods, there are large numbers of entrepreneurs, businesses, cultural workers, NGOs and activities that are not visible, because the work is carried out in homes or in cafes. Local Public Offices would provide a framework that can be filled by existing local businesses, which in turn would stimulate the local environment by becoming visible, by coming together, and by interacting. The Public Office thus has the potential of functioning as a catalyst for opportunities for collaboration and innovation amongst a shared community setting.
