In order to achieve a variety of environments, activities and approaches, we advocate a mix in terms of forms of organization and modes of operation.

We believe it is important that policy-makers encourage and welcome initiatives where independent players are commissioned to design and run activities, such as The Public Office. Our proposed model is that The Public Offices are run by local actors, individually or jointly, and that they can apply for conducting the activity on behalf of the public sector. The operators form and develop activities based on an analysis of the local contextual needs and possibilities.

It should also be possible for a local government and municipal institutions, such as libraries and culture centres, to initiate and run Public Offices, as well as property and housing companies. In most cases it should be possible and beneficial to find forms of cooperation between local actors from civil society, NGO's, businesses, property companies and municipal services.
