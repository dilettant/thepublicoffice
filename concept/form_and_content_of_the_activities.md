The aim is that the different Public Offices in total can provide a variety of environments that can attract different user groups, and in this regard it is important to grant the offices a significant degree of freedom to develop specificities.
	
The activities should be rooted in local and context-specific needs and opportunities. Some Public Offices may have regularly organized activities, and conduct specific activities based on an analysis of the context, while other offices may invite users to self-organize events such as lectures, reading groups, etc.. In some contexts it may also be advantageous to coexist with, or host, other types of activities run by local players, such as clothing and tool libraries, free stores, networking initiatives and so on.
	
The idea of The Public Office is essentially about taking advantage of existing flows and resources; people's movements in a specific area, entrepreneurs and employees working separately in their homes, the voluntary sector and municipal activities. We therefore see an advantage for local development if a substantial share of the Public Office employees and decision-making groups etc., reside in the area. This is to promote stronger local ties as well as to facilitate encounters between different cultural groups in a particular area.
