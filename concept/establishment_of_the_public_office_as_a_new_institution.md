The Public Office can be established as a new local institution in urban development projects. Where residential and commercial buildings are planned, The Public Office can be included to increase the area's appeal as a workplace and living environment. The forms of this planning can be achieved through cooperation between the municipality, the urban developer, housing companies, local civil society and businesses, existing libraries or cultural institutions, and so on.
	
The offices should not require new or specific buildings, but may, for example, be planned on the ground floor of a new block of flats or in other types of available ‘Mixed-Use’ spaces.
