Since The Public Offices are proposed to be public places, they are by definition open to all. The analysis underlying this proposal is essentially based on the increased proportion of freelance and precarious work (4) and a vision of social inclusion through workplace communality. Earlier in the report we have discussed the ways in which The Public Office would constitute support for freelance workers, short-term employees and entrepreneurs. In this section, we will discuss additional user groups that would also benefit from The Public Office. The great potential in terms of users, is precisely the possibility of diversity.  

* People with employment working flexible hours or from home may find important values in having access to a nearby site dedicated to work, and in the opportunity to meet other people.

* Being unemployed and looking for work involves a lot of administration. For job seekers, being in an environment where others are working could have motivational effects, while at the same time offering practical opportunities to establish new professional contacts and develop one's professional skills. The Public Office has the ability to reduce the segregation implied in being outside of the labour market.

* NGO's and non-profit associations are important parts of a local community. Conducting social and non-profit activities involves work requiring professional knowledge and a relevant work situation. Allowing social, non-profit or NGO activities to coexist with other professional and commercial activities should have positive effects on the level of knowledge and exchange of ideas, as well as regarding participation in civil society. The local civil society is also a fundamental factor in developing and spreading a greater local and democratic engagement within a community, and The Public Office would put this commitment into contact with various types of activities.

* People who study can have an enriched experience by coexisting in professional environments. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to students' future establishment – or parallel activities – in the labour market.

* Homeless people need to regularly be in contact with authorities, have opportunities for job training, as well as access to meaningful activities and community. In this respect, The Public Office can function as a welcoming place for people who otherwise are excluded from professional environments and social contexts in which they can meet enterprising individuals. The open commons which The Public Office constitutes, proposes that the community needs more places in which people from different community groups can coexist, see each other, and interact.

* In many respects, our contemporary society is suffering from a strong age segregation. People of all ages are engaged in various types of projects, and most often thrive in the company of others. Many pensioners testify to a great shift in self-image when there is suddenly no job to go to, and a sudden lack of context. Similarly, active young people are often directed to exclusively youth-related activities, such as sports or youth centres. The Public Office has the potential to be a place where people of different ages can partake in projects, discussions or daily administration together.
