It is a generally accepted political description that members of the arts, culture and the creative industries produce important values – economic as well as social and cultural –, constituting a cornerstone in the descriptions of knowledge and creativity as future markets (5). However, there are political inconsistencies in how this thesis operates in practice, since few substantial – in relation to the magnitude of the matter – political actions are made to strengthen the "creative core" of the creative industries theories, i.e. the artists and cultural workers. The Public Office would be a tangible and productive effort to strengthen the working conditions and development opportunities of artists and cultural entrepreneurs.
