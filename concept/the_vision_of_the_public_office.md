What is a Public Office in practice, and how can it work? How can it be initiated, financed and operated? According to which guidelines? Who are the expected users? In this section we develop the answers to such questions, and argue for a multiplicity of frames and activities based in a common frame and shared commitment.

## The public office in practice {#the_public_office_in_practice}

A Public Office is an open and rent-free work and meeting place in which citizens have the opportunity to engage in work and further education.
  
The foundation of The Public Office consists of an open workplace with free access to the internet, electricity, and basic office equipment. Separate meeting rooms and computers on loan can be reserved free of charge. The Public Office can be used for regular or temporary work.
  
The Public Offices may have one or more employees, who welcomes and introduces users to the site and its functions.
  
Print, copy, phone and fax, as well as access to lockers, mobile drawer units or storage spaces can be provided as 'Pay-Per-Use' services. 
  
In direct connection to The Public Office there should be a staffed cafe where the user can pause, socialize and make connections. The cafe can be run in cooperation with existing local cafes, bakeries and so on.
  
Opening hours are proposed to be 8:00 to 22:00 on weekdays and 10:00 to 18:00 on weekends.

## User groups {#user_groups}

Since The Public Offices are proposed to be public places, they are by definition open to all. The analysis underlying this proposal is essentially based on the increased proportion of freelance and precarious work [(1)](#footnotes){#foot1} and a vision of social inclusion through workplace communality. Earlier in the report we have discussed the ways in which The Public Office would constitute support for freelance workers, short-term employees and entrepreneurs. In this section, we will discuss additional user groups that would also benefit from The Public Office. The great potential in terms of users, is precisely the possibility of diversity.  

* People with employment working flexible hours or from home may find important values in having access to a nearby site dedicated to work, and in the opportunity to meet other people.

* Being unemployed and looking for work involves a lot of administration. For job seekers, being in an environment where others are working could have motivational effects, while at the same time offering practical opportunities to establish new professional contacts and develop one's professional skills. The Public Office has the ability to reduce the segregation implied in being outside of the labour market.

* NGO's and non-profit associations are important parts of a local community. Conducting social and non-profit activities involves work requiring professional knowledge and a relevant work situation. Allowing social, non-profit or NGO activities to coexist with other professional and commercial activities should have positive effects on the level of knowledge and exchange of ideas, as well as regarding participation in civil society. The local civil society is also a fundamental factor in developing and spreading a greater local and democratic engagement within a community, and The Public Office would put this commitment into contact with various types of activities.

* People who study can have an enriched experience by coexisting in professional environments. Furthermore, it can be beneficial to students' future establishment – or parallel activities – in the labour market.

* Homeless people need to regularly be in contact with authorities, have opportunities for job training, as well as access to meaningful activities and community. In this respect, The Public Office can function as a welcoming place for people who otherwise are excluded from professional environments and social contexts in which they can meet enterprising individuals. The open commons which The Public Office constitutes, proposes that the community needs more places in which people from different community groups can coexist, see each other, and interact.

* In many respects, our contemporary society is suffering from a strong age segregation. People of all ages are engaged in various types of projects, and most often thrive in the company of others. Many pensioners testify to a great shift in self-image when there is suddenly no job to go to, and a sudden lack of context. Similarly, active young people are often directed to exclusively youth-related activities, such as sports or youth centres. The Public Office has the potential to be a place where people of different ages can partake in projects, discussions or daily administration together.

## Ownership forms and guidelines {#ownership_forms_and_guidelines}

In order to achieve a variety of environments, activities and approaches, we advocate a mix in terms of forms of organization and modes of operation.

We believe it is important that policy-makers encourage and welcome initiatives where independent players are commissioned to design and run activities, such as The Public Office. Our proposed model is that The Public Offices are run by local actors, individually or jointly, and that they can apply for conducting the activity on behalf of the public sector. The operators form and develop activities based on an analysis of the local contextual needs and possibilities.

It should also be possible for a local government and municipal institutions, such as libraries and culture centres, to initiate and run Public Offices, as well as property and housing companies. In most cases it should be possible and beneficial to find forms of cooperation between local actors from civil society, NGO's, businesses, property companies and municipal services.
    
### Suggested guidelines

* the Public Offices shall respect human rights, and strive for equal opportunities for all user groups and individuals

* basic access and activities shall be free of charge, open to the public and not restricted to certain groups

* the openness of the site is regulated, similar to libraries, through clarifications on respectful conduct, such as prohibition against discrimination, violence, threats, drugs and alcohol

* activities are to be designed in close dialogue with the local civil society, businesses and cultural life, and the site's users shall be offered opportunities to make proposals for activities and functions

* the Public Offices shall have staff with the capacity and skills to welcome and assist users, and who are able to evaluate and develop the daily operations and business form

* the premises must be suitable for persons with disabilities

* activities shall be designed according to local needs and opportunities, and engage in context-specific efforts to ensure both general accessibility and exchange, as well as a good working environment

* activities shall at every level, consider aspects of sustainable development and long term use of resources 

* a diversity of staff and decision-making bodies should be sought; in terms of sex, gender identity or gender expression, ethnicity, religion or creed, culture, functionality, sexual orientation and age

* the Public Offices are to facilitate and help all users to meet, support and allow each other to use the site and its functions.

## Forms of funding {#forms_of_funding}

How each individual Public Office is financed will likely take different forms, but the idea is based on the existence of a public commitment that enables the operation. In some places it will be possible to produce revenue, set up local partnerships with businesses, etc.. We also see opportunities for housing companies and property owners to gain interest in leasing premises inexpensively or lending them for free for periods of time, while other situations will require a comprehensive public funding support.
  
This means that the proposal, to achieve a broad impact, requires a political condition where financial support for The Public Office can be applied for in a similar manner as activity support for cultural businesses. The support structures need – to a greater extent than is currently the case for cultural activities – to guarantee serious long-term planning to secure professional operation.
  
Reasonably, the primary financial responsibility should be placed on local/municipal authorities, with support from the state policy level. It is also possible to envisage that the project is initiated from the state level, in the form of a governmental investigation or an official commission of cooperation between relevant authorities and agencies.

### The issue of competition with existing businesses

The idea of The Public Office has been met with questions regarding competition problems. A criticism sometimes brought forward, is that The Public Office would make it difficult for existing players who lease workspaces on a commercial basis.
  
The conclusion of this report, regarding the question of possible distortions of competition, is that all types of public investment affects, facilitates and interacts with different markets. In the end, these are political decisions concerning which infrastructure the community should provide all citizens.


## Form and content of the activities {#form_and_content_of_the_activities}

The aim is that the different Public Offices in total can provide a variety of environments that can attract different user groups, and in this regard it is important to grant the offices a significant degree of freedom to develop specificities.
  
The activities should be rooted in local and context-specific needs and opportunities. Some Public Offices may have regularly organized activities, and conduct specific activities based on an analysis of the context, while other offices may invite users to self-organize events such as lectures, reading groups, etc.. In some contexts it may also be advantageous to coexist with, or host, other types of activities run by local players, such as clothing and tool libraries, free stores, networking initiatives and so on.
  
The idea of The Public Office is essentially about taking advantage of existing flows and resources; people's movements in a specific area, entrepreneurs and employees working separately in their homes, the voluntary sector and municipal activities. We therefore see an advantage for local development if a substantial share of the Public Office employees and decision-making groups etc., reside in the area. This is to promote stronger local ties as well as to facilitate encounters between different cultural groups in a particular area.
