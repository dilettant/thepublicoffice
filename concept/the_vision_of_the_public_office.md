What is a Public Office in practice, and how can it work? How can it be initiated, financed and operate? According to which guidelines? Who are the expected users? In this section we develop the answers to such questions, and argue for a multiplicity of forms and activities based on a common frame and shared commitment.

## The public office in practice {#the_public_office_in_practice}

A Public Office is an open and rent-free work and meeting place where the public has the opportunity to engage in work and further education.

The foundation of The Public Office consists of an open workplace with free access to the internet, electricity, and basic office equipment. Separate meeting rooms and computers on loan can be reserved free of charge. Where possible, there can be additional spaces for specific needs (e.g. silent rooms, rooms for telephone/VOIP conversations and for working in groups etc.). The space should be designed in a way that encourages contact between the users, but doesn't make them feel pressured to interact.

To some extent, spaces in The Public Offices should be available for booking open activities initiated by the users, such as presentations and workshops, association meetings and local political debates, clothing or tool libraries, and so on.

The Public Office can be used for regular or temporary work. An important principle is that the user herself defines what the notion of “work” means. This means that the activities can include wage labour, job seeking, studies, daily administration, participation in social networks, non-profit activities, reading the newspaper, family history research, etc. The main restriction in terms of defining which activities can happen in a Public Office, is that the users have to make it possible for all other users to access and co-exist in the space, and the users may not claim a place or desk as their own. 

The Public Offices may have one or more staff, who welcome and introduce users to the site and its functions. This can be structured in different ways depending on the context and volume of the activities, and in some cases the users themselves can find ways of sharing the responsibilities of hosting. 

Print, copy, phone and fax, should be provided free of charge or at a low cost. Further, access to lockers, mobile drawer units or storage spaces can be provided free of charge, as ‘Pay-Per-Use’ services or through a deposit fee.

The Public Offices should seek cooperation with existing local businesses such as coffee shops and lunch restaurants. A café and various forms of eating possibilities can also be developed as part of the office. An important aspect is that it should be easy for users to come together, take breaks together and so on.

Generous opening hours is an important principle in order to be accessible to flexible work and in order to stimulate a neighbourhood after regular working hours. However, it is also possible to imagine Public Office with more limited hours.

## User groups {#user_groups}

Since The Public Offices are proposed to be public places, they are by definition open to all. The analysis underlying this proposal is essentially based on the increased proportion of freelance and precarious work, and a vision of social inclusion through workplace communality. We have discussed the ways in which The Public Office would constitute support for freelance workers, short-term employees and entrepreneurs. In this section, we will discuss additional user groups that would also benefit from The Public Office. A great potential lies precisely in the accessibility and possibilities for diversity.

* People with employment working flexible hours or from home may find important value in having access to a nearby site dedicated to work, and in the opportunity to meet other people.

* Being unemployed and looking for work involves a lot of administration. For those unemployed, being in an environment where others are working could have motivational effects, while at the same time offering practical opportunities to establish new contacts and develop one’s professional skills. The Public Office could thus contribute to reducing the segregation often implied in being outside of the labour market.

* NGO’s and non-profit associations are important parts of a local community. Conducting social and non-profit activities involves work that requires professional knowledge and a good work situation. It should be easy to organize association meetings, debates and study groups. Lower transaction costs for non-profit and social engagement through open access to meeting places can potentially promote social and political participation.  Allowing social, non-profit or NGO activities to coexist with other professional and commercial activities could have positive effects on the level of knowledge and exchange of ideas, as well as regarding participation in civil society. The local civil society is also a fundamental factor in developing and spreading a greater local and democratic engagement within a community, and The Public Office would put this commitment into contact with various types of activities.

* Students can have an enriched experience by coexisting in professional environments. Furthermore, it can be beneficial to students’ future establishment – or parallel activities – in the labour market.
Access to communication technology is playing an increasingly important role in today's global society. Far from everyone today has access to a computer and internet connection. Therefore, Public Offices, like the public libraries, can be a practical resource for those without access to communication technology in the home or at work.

* Homeless need to regularly be in contact with authorities, have access to opportunities for job training, as well as access to meaningful activities and community. In this respect, The Public Office can function as a welcoming place for people who otherwise are excluded from work environments and social contexts in which they can meet enterprising individuals. The open commons which The Public Office constitutes, proposes that the community needs more places in which people from different community groups can coexist, see each other, and interact.

* In many respects, our contemporary society is suffering from a strong age segregation. People of all ages are engaged in various types of projects, and most often thrive in the company of others. Many pensioners could enjoy carrying out meaningful activities in a common space, whether it means reading the newspaper, doing research or projects, getting support with using a computer or help paying the bills. It's also possible to imagine retirees that would like to share their competence and support other users.

* Similarly, active young people are often directed to exclusively youth-related activities, such as sports or youth centres, separated from adults. Experience of working with young people shows the great amount of ideas that young people often carry, but that lack the relevant fora for development, and that more ideas would survive or become more sustainable if there were environments that encouraged and facilitated development work.

* Citizenship must not be a necessary precondition to use The Public Office.

## Ownership forms and guidelines {#ownership_forms_and_guidelines}

In order for a variety of Public Offices to constitute an accessible infrastructure for as many people as possible, each office should be designed in a specific way, relating to the local context and users. We believe it is difficult to design and provide specific spaces that are attractive to everyone. In order to achieve a variety of environments, activities and approaches, we advocate a mixing of forms of organization and modes of operation.

Our proposed model is that Public Offices are initiated and run by local actors, individually or jointly, and that they can apply for conducting the activity on behalf of the public sector, and/or in collaboration with e.g. housing companies and local businesses. The operators form and develop the activities based on an analysis of the local needs and possibilities. The activities should be guided by common Terms of Use that all Public Offices commit to implementing, and that are continuously and cooperatively developed.

It should also be possible for a local government and municipal institutions, such as libraries and culture centres, as well as for property and housing companies, to initiate Public Offices.  In most cases it should be possible and beneficial to find forms of cooperation between local actors from civil society, NGO’s, businesses, property companies and municipal services.
    
### Suggested guidelines

* the Public Offices shall respect human rights, and strive for equal opportunities for all user groups and individuals

* basic access and activities shall be free of charge, open to the public and not restricted to certain groups

* the openness of the site is regulated, similar to libraries, through Terms of Use and clarifications on respectful conduct, such as prohibition against discrimination, violence, threats, drugs and alcohol

* activities are to be designed in close dialogue with the local civil society, businesses and cultural life, and the users shall be offered opportunities to make proposals for activities and functions

* the Public Offices shall have staff with the capacities and skills to welcome and assist users, and who are able to evaluate and develop daily operations and organizational matters

* the premises must be accessible for persons with disabilities

* activities shall be designed according to local needs and opportunities, and engage in context-specific efforts to ensure both general accessibility and exchange, as well as a good working environment

* at every level, activities shall consider aspects of sustainable development and long term use of resources

* a diversity of staff and decision-making bodies should be sought; in terms of sex, gender identity or gender expression, ethnicity, religion or creed, culture, functionality, sexual orientation and age 

* the Public Offices are to facilitate and help all users to meet, support and allow each other to use the site and its functions.

## Forms of funding {#forms_of_funding}

How each individual Public Office is financed will likely take very different forms. We believe it should be possible to run Public Offices in both public, private and cross-sectoral forms of operation and financing.

The Public Offices can be long-term projects, but also temporary locations that activate and stimulate an environment for a shorter period of time. The goal is a wide variety of Public Offices. An important aspect of the term “public” or common, is the ability of local actors and office users to initiate and develop the activities along with specific local conditions.

The idea of a democratically available infrastructure is based in part on the existence of a political public sector commitment that enables precisely an infrastructure on a larger scale, and in locations with varying conditions. In some places it might be possible to finance activities through local partnerships with housing companies and businesses, while other situations will require a comprehensive public funding.

This means that the proposal, in order to achieve a broad impact, requires a political situation where development and operational support for Public Offices can be applied for in a similar manner as activity support for cultural activities, business development, or public procurement. These supports should be characterized by a serious, advanced planning to ensure continuity and professionalism, but also flexibility for initiatives focused on temporary locations.

Further, it is possible to imagine private and civil society actors that open up their facilities to the public as part of their social responsibility (CSR), and as a way to provide a creative workplace. While a political commitment is a cornerstone of the proposal, it is important to emphasize that the concept is a proposal for collaboration between different economies and actors.

### The issue of competition with existing businesses

The idea of The Public Office has sometimes been met with questions regarding competition problems. One criticism brought forward was that The Public Office would make it difficult for existing players who lease workspaces on a commercial basis.

Our conclusion regarding the question of possible distortions of competition, is that all types of public investment affects, facilitates and interacts with different markets. It's difficult or impossible to draw clear lines of how different economic and political initiatives stimulate or limit parts of the economy as a whole.

In the end, these are political decisions concerning which infrastructure the community should provide for all. Some municipalities offer free public transport, most offer free or subsidized culture, and the state supports corporate business and product development. Some municipalities are designing privatization and public procurement of health care in ways that make it impossible for a staff-run cooperative to give a less costly offer than a large corporation. Given this complexity, it would be oversimplified and fallacious to unilaterally claim that public funding of collective services such as Public Offices would be negative from the perspective of fair competition.

In the same way as book sales are in no way negatively affected by the libraries, nor private gyms by public outdoor gyms, we believe that these open spaces will not reduce the need for offices in general. We are confident that the Public Office as an institution above all would have positive economic effects, which, if properly designed, can both stimulate the economy (by reducing transaction costs for labour, small business and social engagement) and contribute to sustainability (by promoting resource sharing and knowledge development). We regard The Public Office as a public good and an investment that both promotes equality and economic sustainability. 


## Form and content of the activities {#form_and_content_of_the_activities}

The aim is that the different Public Offices in total can provide a variety of environments that can attract different user groups, and in this regard it is important to grant the offices a significant degree of freedom to develop specificities.

The activities should be rooted in local and context-specific needs and opportunities. Some Public Offices may have activities organized by the staff or the municipality, and conduct specific activities based on an analysis of the context, while in other offices users may self-organize events such as lectures, reading groups, etc.. In some contexts it may also be advantageous to coexist with, or host, other types of activities run by local players, such as clothing and tool libraries, free stores, networking initiatives and so on.

The idea of The Public Office is essentially about taking advantage of existing flows and resources; people’s movements in a specific area, entrepreneurs and employees working separately in their homes or spending hours commuting, the non-profit sector and municipal activities. We therefore see an advantage for local development if a substantial share of the Public Office employees and decision-making groups etc., reside in the respective area. This is to promote stronger local ties as well as to facilitate encounters between different cultural groups in a particular area.
