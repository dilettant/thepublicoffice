The vision of The Public Office is comprised of open and rent-free work and meeting places, where citizens have the opportunity to engage in work and further education. The foundation of the idea is the creation of free and democratically available structures for work, where people's time and skills can be shared and enriched. 
	
The concept of The Public Office is an infrastructural proposal and a political vision that seeks to meet the changing needs of the labour markets, characterized by a growing number of people working freelance or from their homes, as well as an increased mobility and flexibility in the work. The Public Office is a proposal aiming to provide greater security, stability and productive development in relation to these new situations and needs.
	
One aspect of the increasingly mobile work situation that is rarely addressed adequately, is the widespread "workplacelessness", which means that many people today lack access to the community, stability and skills development that workplaces can offer. This report highlights the opportunities and valuesâ€‹that can be generated by creating accessible places where people with varying skills and experiences can come together to work alongside each other.
	
Public places for meetings and exchange of knowledge can facilitate new knowledge, networks and local communities. The Public Office, as a local and diverse meeting place, has the potential to promote business development, improve working conditions, skills development, social inclusion and local development.
	
This report proposes an organizational model where Public Offices are primarily initiated by local actors, individually or jointly, and that they can apply for conducting the activity on behalf of the public sector. It should also be possible for a municipality or municipal institution, such as a library, to initiate and run a Public Office.
	
The Public Office may take the form of long-term initiatives, but can also be a temporary projects which activate and stimulate a location for a shorter period of time. The methods of funding The Public Offices may vary depending on location and context, however this report suggests that the core funding should be public.
