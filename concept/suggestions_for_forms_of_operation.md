In this section we discuss and develop proposals regarding forms of operation.

## Establishment of the public office as a new institution {#establishment_of_the_public_office_as_a_new_institution}

The Public Office can be established as a new local institution in urban development projects. Where residential and commercial buildings are planned, The Public Office can be included to increase the area’s appeal as a workplace and living environment. The forms of this planning can be carried out in cooperation between the municipality, the urban developer, housing companies, local civil society and businesses, existing libraries or cultural institutions, and so on.

The offices should not require new or specific buildings, but may, for example, be planned on the ground floor of a new block of flats or in other types of available “mixed-use” spaces.

## Use of temporarily available spaces {#use_of_temporarily_available_spaces}

The Public Office can be housed in spaces that are empty for a period of time. In many cities there are sites of various size and function that remain unused for a number of years, awaiting a new tenant, renovation or a political decision.

The strategy of using unused space holds great potential, especially in terms of using existing resources and activating sites that might otherwise spread a sense of desolation and decay. This strategy proposes that temporary initiatives can have positive and long-term impacts on a neighbourhood and its inhabitants.

Some unused sites would probably need renovation in order to accommodate a public workplace, but the solution as a whole should be beneficial for both the users, property owners and local communities. We therefore consider the proposal of accommodating The Public Office in temporarily unused spaces to be promising for a wide range of stakeholders to invest in.

## Expansion of the mandate of existing institutions {#expansion_of_the_mandate_of_existing_institutions}

Since many aspirations and approaches regarding The Public Office coincide with public libraries, there is reason to inquire into possibilities of incorporating Public Offices into the library structure. To some extent, libraries are already offering places to work and study. However, we believe that The Public Office needs a greater volume and a specific architecture and structure to provide an effective public workplace.

According to this proposal, the public libraries would be granted an extended mandate: to house Public Offices adjacent to the existing library spaces. In practical terms, this could mean that libraries receive support to expand or develop their facilities and operations. Existing structures for library cards, internet access and user information administration can also be used by The Public Office.

It is also possible to envision The Public Office being housed in other types of public cultural institutions; culture centres, performing arts venues, museums and so on. Public cultural institutions, especially the ones devoted to the performing arts, tend to have large surface area, such as foyers, used only at certain times of the day, which could be activated to a much greater extent.
