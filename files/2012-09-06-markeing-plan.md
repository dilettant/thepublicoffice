Please feel free to edit and change and add - this is just a first brainstorm to get started! Eventually consistent... This will have to be reduced in prder to become a marketing plan document, but I wanted to rwite examples and a bit ToDo in order for us to distinguish what is what.

## Questions to Museum

### Prints and informaterial
We would like to print a simple information leaflet to have at the museum, is this something we can print out at the museum?
We are also making posters for the POMA, is it possible for the museum to to print them or does the museum have a deal with a printing house w ecan use? 

### Signs
How does POMA integrate in the museum environment? We would like to place indication signs in connection to the signs already placed in the museum - fixed as well as mobile ones - so as to become an integrated part of the museum and its visitors flow.
We'd like to suggest that for the fixed orientation signs the museum follows the museum formats and design and that the mobile ones correspond to the Publics office own poster.

We think that it would be most useful to meet with head of communications Monica, walk through the museum and discuss the possiblities.
