### Framed subjects:

#### Work

* Contemporary labour markets
	* The mobile/portable work style
		1. Who is this worker?
			* Is it a requirement to have engagement, or can this worker be between jobs etc.?
		2. Define this type of work
			* Where and how does it happen?
			* Means of communication
		3. Define the workspace
			* What is the minimum requirements
				* Working machines/tools
					* What would happen with more tools?
				* Design of the physical space and the web
			* How is it different from cafés, libraries, home etc?
			* Physical, cultural and communication aspects
			* How can we cultivate and develop the mobile work style? How can we trough the PO facilitate a certain cooperation/workflow, knowledge exchange?
		4. Statistics
			* Questions
				* Do you consider that you work in a mobile/portable way?
                	* If, yes, how is your work portable/mobile?
				* Are you without a workplace?
			* Statistics as a sub project (could be pitched to people we meet)
		5. How does it situate itself in the topography of contemporary labour market?

#### Sustainable development

* Public infrastructure
	1. What is the role of public infrastructure in relation to sustainable development? How could PO as a public space fit in to strategies in this area and what values would it correspond? 
		* Local perspective: What could a PO potentially produce/provide for a local community and in urban development?
        	* Risks/aspects of PO playing into a gentrification process?
			* Sharing resources and building on existing resources
		2. How to design for diversity?
    		* in terms of social groups
		3. Open source
			* Commons (define commons)
			* Publishing discoursive practices (Special Issue, week 3)

#### Political dimensions
*Myriam & Anders*

* Ideology & values guiding the PO
	* Cooperation
	* Publicness/commons
	* Diversity etc.
    * Sharing resources
    
* Political areas
	* Labour
    	* the project can challenge the conventional picture of what work is and where it happens, in order to find/instigate more relevant initiatives
		* further articulate how PO relates to the new labour markets
		* PO can visualize/show how the individuals and circulating units work and interact
		* PO as meeting place has the potential to create new connections and jobs, show how energy, time and knowledge is otherwise wasted 
		* check research + examples of offices/designs/methods to know more about how/what could promote "job creation"
		* address the entrepreneur
        
	* Business
    	* Look into the concept of co-working (previously bypass: cluster, synergy, incubators, creative working spaces
 etc) – how is it positive for the development of companies and businesses? 
	* how can POs facilitate a development in methods and organization within freelance companies? (because people will get exposed to new/other ways of working, tools, knowledges etc)
		* democratization of business development
		* remember to frame and narrow these requests according to our ideological interests, there is TONS of bullcrap out there
        
	* Culture
    	* culture/arts as example of expanded/flexible notions of work, freelancers and workplacelessness
		* OBS opportunistic!!! artists in touch with entrepreneurs + companies in touch with creativity = core of contemporary capitalism
		* is it interesting to look at which user groups are using the public library – what in the library structure/space makes it used by so many different people?
        
	* Education
		* Learning in a working environment, how does it work? (LIA = Lärande i arbete) 
		* Research to show how skills are developed in a shared working space/co-working situation
        
	* Other proposals of what to frame as a political area:
		* City/Urban development (probably mostly on a local/regional level)

	* Possible way of addressing politicians and civil servants:
		* What need to happen for this to end up on the political table?

#### Questions
1. Är du arbetsplatslös?
