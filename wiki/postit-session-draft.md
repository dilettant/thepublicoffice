		5. How does it situate itself in the topography of contemporary labour market?

#### Sustainable development

			* Sharing resources
			* Building on existing resources
	* How to design for diversity?
	* Open source

#### Political dimensions
*Myriam & Anders*

* Ideology & values
	* Cooperation
	* Publicness/commons
	* Diversity etc.
    
* Political areas
	* Labour
    	* the project can challenge the conventional picture of what work is and where it happens, in order to find/instigate more relevant initiatives
		* further articulate how PO relates to the new labour markets
		* PO can visualize/show how the individuals and circulating units work and interact
		* PO as meeting place has the potential to create new connections and jobs, show how energy, time and knowledge is otherwise wasted 
		* check research + examples of offices/designs/methods to know more about how/what could promote "job creation"
		* address the entrepreneur
        
	* Business
    	* Look into the concept of co-working (previously bypass: cluster, synergy, incubators, creative working spaces
 etc) – how is it positive for the development of companies and businesses? 
	* how can POs facilitate a development in methods and organization within freelance companies? (because people will get exposed to new/other ways of working, tools, knowledges etc)
		* democratization of business development
		* remember to frame and narrow these requests according to our ideological interests, there is TONS of bullcrap out there
        
	* Culture
    	* culture/arts as example of expanded/flexible notions of work, freelancers and workplacelessness
		* OBS opportunistic!!! artists in touch with entrepreneurs + companies in touch with creativity = core of contemporary capitalism
		* is it interesting to look at which user groups are using the public library – what in the library structure/space makes it used by so many different people?
        
	* Education
		* Learning in a working environment, how does it work? (LIA = Lärande i arbete) 
		* Research to show how skills are developed in a shared working space/co-working situation
        
	* Other proposals of what to frame as a political area:
		* City/Urban development (probably mostly on a local/regional level)

	* Possible way of addressing politicians and civil servants:
		* What need to happen for this to end up on the political table?

#### Questions
1. Är du arbetsplatslös?
