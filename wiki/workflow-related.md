## Assertions

* For now we will use plain pages instead of _posts to avoid the naming conventions overlad.
* We will use issues as
	* To-dos
    * Forum/discussions
* Milestones in the issues section as milestones/deadlines
* Project's main repository as the main web page hosting
* Wiki directory inside the main repository to publish our notes etc (should this be renamed to something else than wiki?)

### Assets

* Linnked files and embedded assets should be hosted in an external dropbox account and linked directly
	* If the browsers can handel the type of file, leave it as is
    * If the browser cannot handle the file type (i.e. spreadsheets etc) zip it
* look into some javascript plugin to replace audio and video links with embed codes
