## Intention

In this document I will try to describe our internal workflow, the different tools we will need and how to combine them all in order to be able to in one hand publish our reflections and discoveries in the wiki, and in the other hand keep the website updated and all of it using the same platform.

## Useful resources

This section will mostly be a collection of readings that inspired and guided our workflow troughout the project.

* [Eventually consistent](http://prose.io/help/eventually-consistent.html) – by  [Michael Aufreiter](https://github.com/michael) – Almost a manifesto on how to keep documentation alive and open.
* [Introducing Prose: A Content Editor for GitHub](http://rdd.me/kpglkuwl) – by  [Michael Aufreiter](https://github.com/michael) – As the title says this outlines the use of Prose.io to update github.com hosted projects, like ours.
* [Using Jekyll and GitHub Pages for Our Site](http://rdd.me/urh4e7ni) – by [Young Hahn](https://github.com/yhahn) – Extensive description on how to use github as a web hosting service
* [How We Build CMS-Free Websites](http://rdd.me/v8scoivo) – by [Dave Cole](https://github.com/dhcole) – Yet another explanation on how to use github as a web support platform.
