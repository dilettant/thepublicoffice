  <div class="hentry-content"><p>In order to achieve a variety of environments, activities and approaches, we advocate a mix in terms of forms of organization and modes of operation.</p>

<p>We believe it is important that policy-makers encourage and welcome initiatives where independent players are commissioned to design and run activities, such as The Public Office. Our proposed model is that The Public Offices are run by local actors, individually or jointly, and that they can apply for conducting the activity on behalf of the public sector. The operators form and develop activities based on an analysis of the local contextual needs and possibilities.</p>

<p>It should also be possible for a local government and municipal institutions, such as libraries and culture centres, to initiate and run Public Offices, as well as property and housing companies. In most cases it should be possible and beneficial to find forms of cooperation between local actors from civil society, NGO&#8217;s, businesses, property companies and municipal services.</p>

<p><em>Suggested guidelines</em></p>

<ul>
<li>the Public Offices shall respect human rights, and strive for equal opportunities for all user groups and individuals</li>

<li>basic access and activities shall be free of charge, open to the public and not restricted to certain groups</li>

<li>the openness of the site is regulated, similar to libraries, through clarifications on respectful conduct, such as prohibition against discrimination, violence, threats, drugs and alcohol</li>

<li>activities are to be designed in close dialogue with the local civil society, businesses and cultural life, and the site&#8217;s users shall be offered opportunities to make proposals for activities and functions</li>

<li>the Public Offices shall have staff with the capacity and skills to welcome and assist users, and who are able to evaluate and develop the daily operations and business form</li>

<li>the premises must be suitable for persons with disabilities</li>

<li>activities shall be designed according to local needs and opportunities, and engage in context-specific efforts to ensure both general accessibility and exchange, as well as a good working environment</li>

<li>activities shall at every level, consider aspects of sustainable development and long term use of resources</li>

<li>a diversity of staff and decision-making bodies should be sought; in terms of sex, gender identity or gender expression, ethnicity, religion or creed, culture, functionality, sexual orientation and age</li>

<li>the Public Offices are to facilitate and help all users to meet, support and allow each other to use the site and its functions.</li>
