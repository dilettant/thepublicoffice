  <div class="hentry-content"><p>How each individual Public Office is financed will likely take different forms, but the idea is based on the existence of a public commitment that enables the operation. In some places it will be possible to produce revenue, set up local partnerships with businesses, etc.. We also see opportunities for housing companies and property owners to gain interest in leasing premises inexpensively or lending them for free for periods of time, while other situations will require a comprehensive public funding support.</p>

<p>This means that the proposal, to achieve a broad impact, requires a political condition where financial support for The Public Office can be applied for in a similar manner as activity support for cultural businesses. The support structures need – to a greater extent than is currently the case for cultural activities – to guarantee serious long-term planning to secure professional operation.</p>

<p>Reasonably, the primary financial responsibility should be placed on local/municipal authorities, with support from the state policy level. It is also possible to envisage that the project is initiated from the state level, in the form of a governmental investigation or an official commission of cooperation between relevant authorities and agencies.</p>

<p><em>The issue of competition with existing businesses</em> The idea of The Public Office has been met with questions regarding competition problems. A criticism sometimes brought forward, is that The Public Office would make it difficult for existing players who lease workspaces on a commercial basis.</p>

<p>The conclusion of this report, regarding the question of possible distortions of competition, is that all types of public investment affects, facilitates and interacts with different markets. In the end, these are political decisions concerning which infrastructure the community should provide all citizens.</p></div>
