<p>Work flow set up: tools, communication and routines</p>

<ul>
<li>issues of importance for everyone will be initiated and organized by the person(s) having the request/task. The person(s) will call or email everyone individually to check the availability and then propose a time (+ place for the Sthlm crew). Everyone is responsible for keeping each other in the loop and in the group.</li>

<li>we all start using and learning about GitHub now. There is yet no protocol or form that is right or wrong, but we try/develop together. Everyone can give input into discussions/issues and the responsible people for a certain area make the final decision + close the issue.</li>
