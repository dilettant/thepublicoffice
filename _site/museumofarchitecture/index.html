<p>New times have changed the conditions for what we perceive as common. How have perceptions of, and use of, public environments changed in the recent decades? What function could public offices fill?</p>

<p>Talks by Karin Bradley (Department of Urban Planning and Environment, KTH) , Monica Fundin Pourshahidi (The Swedish Museum of Architecture) and Dilettant, who will present The Public Office project and introduce the space. Mingle, snacks and alcohol-free drinks – welcome!</p>

    <h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>
    <p>Are you working or studying at home, in cafes or libraries? Do you long for a workplace and community where you can work side by side with others? An open and free site to share ideas, have meetings and support each other at work? If so, we propose you to bring your work to the temporary public office at the Swedish Museum of Architecture in Stockholm.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2 id="what_we_have">What we have</h2>
    <p>The Public Office at the Museum of Architecture is open Tuesday-Saturday at 10.00-18.00, 30 October-30 November. The office has space for 20-30 people to work, and basic office equipment such as wireless internet, printer, scanner and copier. The project team is here to introduce you to the space and its functions.</p>

<p>There are additional nearby spaces for meetings and lectures that can be booked, so let us know if you would like to organize something that might not fit in the office space. Next to the office there is also a nice café.</p>

    <h2 id="what_you_need">What you need</h2>
    <p>You will have to bring your own work tools; your laptop, tablet, paper and pen etc. We also ask you to keep in mind that everyone should be able to work in The Public Office. Together we will create a good environment for co-working and try out different ways to interact. If you have specific questions about whether your type of work is possible at The Public Office, or if you want to make sure the space is not full – give us a call!</p>

    <h2 id="the_project">The project</h2>
    <p>The Public Office at The Swedish Museum of Architecture in Stockholm, 30 Oct-30 Nov 2012, is part of a long term development project, that aims to articulate an idea of open and rent-free work and meeting places, where the public is given the opportunity to engage in work and further education. The foundation of the idea is the creation of free and democratically available structures for work, where people&#8217;s time and competences can be shared and enrich each other.
