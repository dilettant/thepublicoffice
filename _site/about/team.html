      <p><p>Victor has a background in Music Composition and Software Development. After completing his Sound Engineering Degree he wrote music both in the commercial and artistic worlds. At the same time he led a small startup in Madrid where he worked as a developer for many years. Lately Victor has been trying to get involved in projects with broader scopes than &#8220;deadlines&#8221; and &#8220;clients&#8221; when writing music or code. For that reason he decided to join the online Open-source community and start using his time trying to help other people with the same goals.</p></p>
