Victor has a background in Music Composition and Software Development. After completing his Sound Engineering Degree he wrote music both in the commercial and artistic worlds. At the same time he led a small startup in Madrid where he worked as a developer for many years. Lately Victor has been trying to get involved in projects with broader scopes than "deadlines" and "clients" when writing music or code. For that reason he decided to join the online Open-source community and start using his time trying to help other people with the same goals.
