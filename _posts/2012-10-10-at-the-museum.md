# The Public office
## At the museum of architecture

### Intro
Are you working or studying in your home, in cafes or libraries? Do you long for a workplace and community to work with others? A open and free site to share ideas, have meetings and support each other at work?

Welcome to bring your work to The Public Office at The Museum of Architecture in Stockholm.

### What we have
At the museum we have space for 20 or 30 people to work. You will find basic office equipment such as wireless internet, printer, scanner and copier. We beleive that by sharing what you know or asking for help we often end up with better results, so we will try aswell to facilitate tools for you to interact and exchange your work with others if you whish to do so. 

### What you need
You will have to bring your own tools here; your latop, mouse, tablet etc. We also ask you to keep in mind that everyone should be able to work in the Public Office. This means that  meetings with large groups who need to use the entire space can be difficult. However, there are additional nearby spaces for meetings and lectures that can be booked. Together we will find a good way and sound level, the ways to interact, and make adjustments as the project progresses. If you have specific questions about whether your type of work is possible at The Public Office, or if you want to make sure the space is not full – give us a call!  

### How to get here
Address: Exercisplan and Slupskjulsplan, Skeppsholmen, Stockholm – The Architecture Museum is located in the same building as Moderna Museet. Signs in the museum will show the way to the workspace

### The Project
The Public Office at The Museum of Architecture in Stockholm, 30 Oct-30 Nov 2012, is part of a long term development project, that aims to articulate an idea of open and rent-free work and meeting places, where citizens are given the opportunity to engage in work and further education. The foundation of the idea is the creation of free and democratically available structures for work, where people's time and competences can be shared and enrich each other.
