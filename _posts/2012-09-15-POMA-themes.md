#Background

The second direction of the research work is conducted primarily by the project team of Dilettant AB, along with invited guests. To further develop and articulate the concept of The Public Office, three main topics have been identified for further exploration during the period at the Museum of Architecture;

* Work – what does the contemporary worker, labor market and workplace look like?

* Sustainable development – local development, sharing of resources, commons and open source.

* Political dimensions – relevant policy areas and ideological grounds.

These topics will be explored in order to build, develop and strengthen the concept of The Public Office and will, continuously during the project, develop the publication "The Public Office – a vision of open and rent-free work and meeting places." Research work will primarily be carried out through dialogue meetings with invited guests; politicians, civil servants, researchers, organizations, etc.. Dialogue meetings serve the dual function of providing input to the idea of The Public Office, while publishing the concept to key stakeholders that may be relevant to the concept's future establishment. The meetings will not be public events, but will take place in the Public Office at The Museum of Architecture.

Dilettant AB is responsible for organizing the dialogue meetings, invite guests, etc., and is happy to be in dialogue with the museum regarding relevant guests to invite.

### Framed subjects:

#### Work

* Contemporary labour markets
	* The mobile/portable work style
		1. Who is this worker?
			* Is it a requirement to have engagement, or can this worker be between jobs etc.?
		2. Define this type of work
			* Where and how does it happen?
			* Means of communication
		3. Define the workspace
			* What is the minimum requirements
				* Working machines/tools
					* What would happen with more tools?
				* Design of the physical space and the web
			* How is it different from cafés, libraries, home etc?
			* Physical, cultural and communication aspects
			* How can we cultivate and develop the mobile work style? How can we trough the PO facilitate a certain cooperation/workflow, knowledge exchange?
		4. Statistics
			* Questions
				* Do you consider that you work in a mobile/portable way?
                	* If, yes, how is your work portable/mobile?
				* Are you without a workplace?
			* Statistics as a sub project (could be pitched to people we meet)
		5. How does it situate itself in the topography of contemporary labour market?

#### Sustainable development

* Public infrastructure
	* What is the role of public infrastructure in relation to sustainable development? How could PO as a public space fit in to strategies in this area and what values would it correspond? 
		1. Local perspective: What could a PO potentially produce/provide for a local community and in urban development?
        	* Risks/aspects of PO playing into a gentrification process?
			* Sharing resources and building on existing resources
		2. How to design for diversity?
    		* in terms of social groups
		3. Open source
			* Commons (define commons)
			* Publishing discoursive practices (Special Issue, week 3)

#### Political dimensions
*Myriam & Anders*

* Ideology & values guiding the PO
	* Cooperation
	* Publicness/commons
	* Diversity etc.
    * Sharing resources
    
* Political areas
	* Labour
    	* the project can challenge the conventional picture of what work is and where it happens, in order to find/instigate more relevant initiatives
		* further articulate how PO relates to the new labour markets
		* PO can visualize/show how the individuals and circulating units work and interact
		* PO as meeting place has the potential to create new connections and jobs, show how energy, time and knowledge is otherwise wasted 
		* check research + examples of offices/designs/methods to know more about how/what could promote "job creation"
		* address the entrepreneur
        
	* Business
    	* Look into the concept of co-working (previously bypass: cluster, synergy, incubators, creative working spaces
 etc) – how is it positive for the development of companies and businesses? 
	* how can POs facilitate a development in methods and organization within freelance companies? (because people will get exposed to new/other ways of working, tools, knowledges etc)
		* democratization of business development
		* remember to frame and narrow these requests according to our ideological interests, there is TONS of bullcrap out there
        
	* Culture
    	* culture/arts as example of expanded/flexible notions of work, freelancers and workplacelessness
		* OBS opportunistic!!! artists in touch with entrepreneurs + companies in touch with creativity = core of contemporary capitalism
		* is it interesting to look at which user groups are using the public library – what in the library structure/space makes it used by so many different people?
        
	* Education
		* Learning in a working environment, how does it work? (LIA = Lärande i arbete) 
		* Research to show how skills are developed in a shared working space/co-working situation
        
	* Other proposals of what to frame as a political area:
		* City/Urban development (probably mostly on a local/regional level)

	* Possible way of addressing politicians and civil servants:
		* What need to happen for this to end up on the political table?

#### Questions
1. Är du arbetsplatslös?


#### Potential dialogue partners
 * Individuals
 * Groups
