## Notes from work weekend in August 2012

* develop more the difference from library, café  
* specify what is a workplace  
* how is the sharing facilitated in the PO?  
* user groups are effected by who initiates the PO  
* develop the features, architecture and functions to facilitate organic interaction  
* how politically agnostic can the proposal be?  
* highlight organizer vs. user perspective  
* what kind of tool set in order for people to engage?  
* highlight sociological aspects, ie sustainability  
* bring out relevant statistics about "workplacelessness"  
* develop the picture/figure of the mobile singular worker  
* business form in relation to profession  
* highlight the creative knowledge economy  
* develop tools for sharing what one is working on (also connected to Special Issue)  
* what is the lifestyle of a possible user  
* to explain how the PO is a space designed for interaction for those who want  
* political "dimensions" rather than "issues"  
* a PO could, like libraries, be a natural part of the social tissue  
* develop the potential of sharing knowledge, specific to the PO

* highlight the right to work  
* strengthen the ideas of local development  
* user groups: speak to organizations working with different groups  
* wait with ownership and financing etc  
* visualizing the use of existing resources, sharing flow etc, to show the scale of "scattered" work  
* possibly highlight the temporary use of unused spaces  
* starting from the political dimensions: invite the parties to discuss the report  
* example of features/services (book keeping)   

#Political dimensions

###Labour market
* the project can challenge the conventional picture of what work is and where it happens, in order to find/instigate more relevant initiatives  
* further articulate how PO relates to the new labour markets  
* PO can visualize/show how the individuals and circulating units work and interact  
* PO as meeting place has the potential to create new connections and jobs, show how energy, time and knowledge is otherwise wasted   
* check research + examples of offices/designs/methods to know more about how/what could promote "job creation"  
* address the entrepreneur  

###Business
* Look into the concept of co-working (previously bypass: cluster, synergy, incubators, creative working spaces etc) – how is it positive for the development of companies and businesses?   
* how can POs facilitate a development in methods and organization within freelance companies? (because people will get exposed to new/other ways of working, tools, knowledges etc)  
* democratization of business development  
* remember to frame and narrow these requests according to our ideological interests, there is TONS of bullcrap out there  

###Culture
* culture/arts as example of expanded/flexible notions of work, freelancers and workplacelessness  
* OBS opportunistic!!! artists in touch with entrepreneurs + companies in touch with creativity = core of contemporary capitalism  
* is it interesting to look at which user groups are using the public library – what in the library structure/space makes it used by so many different people?  

###Education
* Learning in a working environment, how does it work? (LIA = Lärande i arbete)   

*To discuss:*
* What need to happen for this to end up on the political table?
