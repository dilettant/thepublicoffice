# Protocol Dialogue meeting #1
  
## Guest: Roland Paulsen, Dep of Sociology / Uppsala University   
http://www.soc.uu.se/sv/personal/roland-paulsen/   
From The Public Office: Anders Jacobson & Myriam Mazzoni    
  
### Roland Paulsen about his field of research
Paulsens book "The Work Society – How Work has survived Technology": starts from wanting to understand how it is, that inspite of the progress of technological  development which in theory allows us to work more efficentlya, and thus working less, we in fact work and produce more than ever.  What are the economical, historical ideas and reasons for this development? When productivity keeps increasing – what are the reasons behind the dominant political and economical discourse of "creating jobs"? 
                                      
Paulsen states that ”the work society”, through promoting work for work's sake, not only creates an overproduction and waste, but also creates the need to create meaningless work. 

He argues for a reduction of work time and to separate income from work in favour of a basic income (“citizens salary”) in order to free time and creativity that would enable the creation/production of other types of social values. Paulsen says an important strategy to make us less dependent of wage labour is to develop more and larger commons. 

In his book, Paulsen maps out the historical reasons for our often contradictory notion of work, and clarifies that on the one hand, work is percieved as more than a duty, it's a necessity/constraint we are coerced into in order to earn our right as a full  member of society and contribute to building a material wealth. On the other hand, work is expected to be the arena of your self fullfillment and creativity in life. 

## Summary of discussions based on our questions  

### The right to work
Work as a coersion (forced labour) could be regarded as the traditional ”reason” for working – either the need for producing products for survival, for a landowner, or for paying taxes. Throughout history work has been increasingly connected to the notion of self realization and social mobility – we want to work because it makes us someone, and because we want to contribute to economic growth and general welfare. This has taken the curious shift in mentality that the states are, according to the UN declaration of human rights (used in the report), obliged to create jobs and good working conditions. One could say that jobs used to be a means of producing economic and material wealth, and now it has become an end in it self. The disourse has even flipped all the way around: we need to produce economic growth in order to create jobs.  

In the context of the Public Office, the right to work can be used more extensively, as a way to expand the PO concept as an investment in, or part of, an infrastructure in contemporary knowledge society, as it provides a frame for life long learning, skills development and peer-to-peer learning. Further it promotes the right to good working conditions, and this can be directly linked to the proposal of using empty spaces for Public Offices – it is not impossible to imagine laws that would make it mandatory to make empty spaces availible for public use.  

### What is work:
Work could basically be said to be any activity that could be compensated with a salary. Since in the "advanced economies", self-sustainance (e.g. producing your own food, clothes etc) has come to a minimun through the development of greater economic growth and distribution of labour – more or less everything can be provided by "the market". This in turn allows more or less everything possible to be considered as work – cleaning, childcare, cooking, home-delivery, networking etc: the notion of work expands. There are also more and more areas where consumption and work are combined – self-service cashier at the grocery store, internet banking etc.   

Since work in many ways is connected to the idea of contributing to the wealth of a society (through taxes but increasingly through the economic activity and growth as an end of it's own), being unemployed – and not working in general – becomes more stigmatized. We also tend to call activities "work" in order to upgrade their value ("i need to work" sounds more important than "i need to have fun"). Wage labour frames what is considered "real work" and fills it with a sense of importance and legitimacy, even though also studies, looking for work, doing family research, paying bills, fixing a leaking pipe etc, can be equaly much work. So as wage labor decreases (compared to early industrial period) – 8 hour working day in stead of 12, longer holidays, longer parental leave etc – in a formal sense, and economic productivity increases – we are working more than ever.  

As the notion of work expands, there are less and less boundairies to define its activities.  But work has also expanded in time and geography as the boundaries for when and where work is done have become blurry, to say the least. We work at several places and during a greater part of the day.  

We *could* spend less time working and still have a sustainable macro economy. Working itself can become more sustainable if it is connected to a place – a workplace – that sets borders for when and where it takes place. Further, lowering the costs of work and skills development could improve working conditions, not only in terms of environment, but by allowing us to earn a bit less and thus limit the working time.  

Is it relevant in the context of Public Offices to define what is work and not? 
Since the notion of work has been expanding to include almost any activity that produces value, and since also many forms of leisure/free time could be said to stimulate production, PO does not need to define what is work or not. On the contrary, there's an important point in terms of empowerment and freedom that it's up to the users to define and validate what they consider work.   

### Does the Public Office reinforce the political discourses that work/employment is the main function in life and and in a society? 
An important and interesting possibility with The Public Office, is that people can themselves define what they consider work. This could loosen up the strict borders of what is considered productive activity, and thus enable more empowerment based on the individual's own desired activity. It also provides an open frame to discuss the issue of types of work that falls outside of the definition of wage labour.  

The type of communality and grass-roots knowledge exchange that could emerge at The Public Office is probably a more humane, open and empowering alternative than current political programs against unemployment, such as Fas 3. The Public Office trusts that people have the capacity and creativity to learn peer-to-peer, and need not be told what to do in order to develop, get a job, or run a business. It could offer a less hierarchical environment where contacts and knowledge can grow organically, starting from people's own initiative, and through continuity. It can also become a place for activity where you are not judged or categorized depending on your level of income. In the 19th century, some thinkers agrued for "open workshops” emphasizing the possibilities for unexpected creativity and activity when the tools are avalible to everyone.  

### Work and health
Paulsens research shows that the conventional idea is that unemployment is bad for health. In fact, it is not necessarily the work itself that makes people healthy – but rather the communality of colleagues, access to knowledge, a set time frame, regular meals etc. Some studies show that people with precarious working conditions have worse health than people who are unemployed.  

The Public Office could, from this angle, be an initiative that by providing a physical place for work – be the user employed, freelance, community organizer, pensioner or unemployed – provide an infrastructure of those factors that promotes better health mentioned above. Worth noting is also that the common physical place has an increasingly important function in times when people and work get less and less bound to certain locations.  

### A physical place for sharing in relation to sustainable development
In relation to the question of sustainable development in a world with lesser resources but growing production and consumption, The Public Offices could – by sharing resources, space and knowledge through an open source mentality – contribute to a more reasonable and sustainable use of common resources.  

### Gentrification?
As long as Public Office remains a public space, i.e. free of charge and open to anyone, it would most probably not support the logic of a gentrification process, a logic that creates gentrification through economical exclusion or inaccessibility for certain groups. The public space could in stead *as such*  work against such tendencies by making resources availible for everyone. 

### Conclusions and tips for the report
* PO is a way of making the access to work more accessible – it challenges the exclusivity of wage labor and aims to make tools and resources availible for everyone
* PO makes visible the social aspects of work
* Push harder on the issue of using empty spaces – refer to examples, in Sweden and in other countries, e.g, NYC and Berlin
* In general, back up statements by referring to examples or statistics
* Emphasize The Right to Work more – there could be laws about using unused spaces for public use
* Develop thoughts around the fact that the public libraries need to update their functions
* Continue to articulate the difference between PO and the library, the café, the conventional co-working space etc. 
* Work more on the issue of competition. Also in relation to the public libraries – PO *could* compete with the libraries in a negative way – especially if it takes the form of yet another public institution – by providing a more contemporary type of service 
* Maybe mention/relate to ”arbetslinjen” – the current work/employment politics
