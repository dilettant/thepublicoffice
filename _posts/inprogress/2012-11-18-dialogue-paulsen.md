From The Public Office: Anders Jacobson & Myriam Mazzoni    
  
### Roland Paulsen about his field of research  
Paulsen's book "The Work Society – How Work has survived Technology": starts from wanting to understand how it is, that in spite of the progress of technological  development which in theory allows us to work more efficiently, and thus working less, we in fact work and produce more than ever.  What are the economical, historical ideas and reasons for this development? When productivity keeps increasing – what are the reasons behind the dominant political and economical discourse of "creating jobs"?  
                                      
Paulsen states that ”the work society”, through promoting work for work's sake, not only creates an overproduction and waste, but through the same logic, also creates (a need to create) meaningless work.  

He argues for a reduction of work time and to separate income from work in favor of a basic income (“citizens salary”) in order to free time and creativity that would enable the creation/production of other types of social and economical values. Paulsen says an important strategy to make us less dependent of wage labour is to develop more and larger commons.  

In his book, Paulsen maps out the historical reasons for our often contradictory notion of work, and clarifies that on the one hand, work is perceived as more than a duty, it's a necessity/constraint we are coerced into in order to earn our right as a full  member of society and contribute to building a material wealth. On the other hand, work is expected to be the arena of your self fulfillment and creativity in life. Since the latter is the case for very few,  and because of the confusion of expectations on what work is, work is bound to make us unhappy.  

## Summary of discussions based on our questions  

### What is work  
Work can basically be said to be any activity that is compensated with a salary. Since in the "advanced economies", self-sustenance (e.g. producing your own food, clothes etc) has come to a minimum through the development of greater economic growth and distribution of labour – more or less everything can be provided by "the market". This in turn allows for more or less everything  to be considered as work – cleaning, childcare, cooking, home-delivery, networking etc: the notion of work expands.      

Since work in many ways is connected to the idea of contributing to the wealth of a society (through taxes but increasingly through  economic activity and growth as an end in it's own), being unemployed – or not working in general – becomes more stigmatized. We also tend to call activities "work" in order to upgrade their value ("i need to work" sounds more important than "i need to have fun"). Wage labour frames what is considered "real work" and fills it with a sense of importance and legitimacy, even though also studies, looking for work, doing family research, paying bills, fixing a leaking pipe etc, can  equally be considered  work. So as wage labor decreases (compared to early industrial period) – 8 hour working day in stead of 12, longer holidays, longer parental leave etc – in a formal sense, and economic productivity increases – we are working more than ever.  

As the notion of work expands, there are less and less boundaries to define its activities.  But work has also expanded in time and geography as the boundaries for when and where work is done have become blurry, to say the least. We work in several places and during a greater part of the day.  

This raises the aspect that working itself can become more sustainable if it is connected to a place – a workplace – that sets limits for when and where it takes place. Further, lowering the costs for work and skills development could improve working conditions, not only in terms of environment, but by allowing us to earn a bit less and thus limit the working time.  


### The right to work  
Work as a coersion (forced labour) could be regarded as the traditional ”reason” for working – either the need for producing products for survival, for a landowner, or for paying taxes.  In recent history work has been increasingly connected to the notion of self realization and social mobility – we want to work because it makes us into someone, and because we want to contribute to economic growth and general welfare. With the UN decalaration of human rights, declaring the obligation of states to create jobs and good working conditions, a quite drastic shift of our relationship to work is being highlighted and underpinned. Paulsen says  that if jobs used to be a means of producing economic and material wealth, it has nowbecome an end in it self  and the discourse has  flipped all the way around: we need to produce economic growth in order to create jobs.    

In the context of the Public Office, Paulsen proposes that the right to work can be used more extensively, expanding the PO concept as an investment in, or part of, an infrastructure in contemporary knowledge society, as it provides a frame for life long learning, skills development and peer-to-peer learning. Further it would promote the right to good working conditions, which can be directly linked to the proposal of using empty spaces for Public Offices – it is not impossible to imagine laws that would make it mandatory to make empty spaces available for public use.  


### Does the Public Office reinforce the political discourses that work/employment is the main function in life and and in a society?   

An important and interesting possibility with The Public Office, is that people can themselves define what they consider work. This could loosen up the strict borders of what is considered productive activity, and thus enable more empowerment based on the individual's own desired activity. It also provides an open frame to discuss the issue of types of work that falls outside of a traditional definition of wage labour.  

Paulsen comments that the type of communality and grass-roots knowledge exchange that could emerge at The Public Office is probably a more humane, open and empowering alternative than current political programs against unemployment, such as Fas 3. The Public Office trusts in people's own capacity and creativity to learn peer-to-peer, . It could offer a less hierarchical environment where contacts and knowledge can grow organically, starting from people's own initiative, and through continuity. It can also become a place of activity where you are not judged or categorized depending on your level of income. In the 19th century, some thinkers argued for "open workshops” emphasizing the possibilities for unexpected creativity and activity when the tools are available to everyone.  

### Work and health  
Paulsen's research shows that althoug the general idea is that unemployment is bad for healthit is not necessarily work itself that would makepeople healthy – but rather the communality of colleagues, access to knowledge, a set time frame, regular meals etc. Some studies also show that people with precarious working conditions have worse health than people who are unemployed.    

From this angle,The Public Office ,  as an initiative providing a physical place for work – be the user employed, freelance, community organizer, pensioner or unemployed – could also offer an infrastructure for those factors that promote better health mentioned above. Worth noting, is  that the common physical place has an increasingly important function in times when people and work are less and less bound to certain locations.  

### A physical place for sharing in relation to sustainable development  
In relation to the question of sustainable development the Public Offices could – by sharing resources, space and knowledge through an open source mentality – contribute to a more reasonable and sustainable use of common resources.    

### Gentrification?  
As long as the Public Office remains a public space, i.e. free of charge and open to anyone, it would in theory not play into the logic of a gentrification process, a logic that creates gentrification through economical exclusion or inaccessibility for certain groups. The public space could in stead *as such*  work against such tendencies by making resources available for everyone.  

### Conclusions and tips for the report  
* PO is a way of making the access to work more accessible – it challenges the exclusivity of wage labor and aims to make tools and resources available for everyone  
* PO makes visible the social aspects of work  
* Push harder on the issue of using empty spaces – refer to examples, in Sweden and in other countries, e.g, NYC and Berlin (Tempelhof)  
* In general, back up statements by referring to examples or statistics  
* Emphasize The Right to Work more – there could be laws about using unused spaces for public use  
* Develop thoughts around the fact that the public libraries need to update their functions  
* Continue to articulate the difference between PO and the library, the café, the conventional co-working space etc.   
* Work more on the issue of competition. Also in relation to the public libraries – PO *could* compete with the libraries in a negative way – especially if it takes the form of yet another public institution – by providing a more contemporary type of service   
* Maybe mention/relate to ”arbetslinjen” – the current politics of work society
