### Important Info to everyone

### Paris trip
* PO presentation: who does it? Who says what?
* Logistics and budget: Alice
* Per diems: invoiced or Les labos can simply deduct from our budget? Do we need to adjust the per diem amount 300?
* no problem to change 10% between posts 
* Suggestions for SI@POMA: 
	* We invite you to come and to be part of the PO, as users. 
	* It is what each specific partner finds interesting in the project and their understaning of it that is the starting point focus for dialogue. 
    * Sharing is a way of publishing discourse, Public space publishes discourse - PO is clearly setting a discourse, how is it producing this discourse. What is this discourse, How do you interpret it.
    * we are finiding out the limitations of what we can facilitate or have room for
    * Alice: how it conceptually fits in to SI.
