## 2. Project Description
During the period 30 October to 30 November 2012, Dilettant AB (formerly Hybris Konstproduktion AB) will stage a public office at the Swedish Museum of Architecture in Stockholm. The project at the Museum of Architecture is the second part of the long-term development project The Public Office, whose goal is to articulate and explore opportunities to develop open and rent-free work and meeting places. As a basis for the work at the museum, of is the text/report "Public office – a vision of open and rent-free work and meeting places" ( http://hybriskonst.org/en/blogg/the-public-office-report-project-part-1 ) produced during the project's first part.

The working period at the Museum of Architecture consists of two parallel explorations, both with the overall objective to further articulate the concept of the "The Public Office":

### 2.1. Articulate the identity, specificity, functionality and users of The Public Office
In order to specify what is specific to The Public Office space and function, Dilettant AB will create a public office in the Museum of Architecture. This means that the public is welcome to use the room as a workplace during the opening hours. The focus in this part of the project involves reaching out to the project's primary target group – freelancers and temporary workers – through relevant channels and networks, and to ensure that the public office at the Museum of Architecture is used during the project period. Since one of the basic ideas of The Public Office is about sharing skills and creating community, we will explore ways in which the Public Office users can interact in relevant ways. An important aspect of the project preparation thus consists in designing the project space and its functions in a relevant way, to create a productive and pleasant working environment. All who come to use the Public Office,  contributes through their attendance and by sharing their work and knowledge. This work; to test, specify and concretize what a Public Office is (for example, as opposed to a library, coffee shop or commercial co-working space), includes the exploration of the different user groups that future Public Offices might attract.

Dilettant AB is responsible, in dialogue with the Museum of Architecture, for that the room becomes functional for the visitors/users, as well as for promoting the project through relevant channels with the goal of maximizing its use.

### 2.2. Increase the knowledge of surrounding key issues in relation to The Public Office as a concept

The second direction of the research work is conducted primarily by the project team of Dilettant AB, along with invited guests. To further develop and articulate the concept of The Public Office, three main topics have been identified for further exploration during the period at the Museum of Architecture;

* Work – what does the contemporary worker, labor market and workplace look like?
* Sustainable development – local development, sharing of resources, commons and open source.
* Political dimensions – relevant policy areas and ideological grounds.

These topics will be explored in order to build, develop and strengthen the concept of The Public Office and will, continuously during the project, develop the publication "The Public Office – a vision of open and rent-free work and meeting places." Research work will primarily be carried out through dialogue meetings with invited guests; politicians, civil servants, researchers, organizations, etc.. Dialogue meetings serve the dual function of providing input to the idea of The Public Office, while publishing the concept to key stakeholders that may be relevant to the concept's future establishment. The meetings will not be public events, but will take place in the Public Office at The Museum of Architecture.

Dilettant AB is responsible for organizing the dialogue meetings, invite guests, etc., and is happy to be in dialogue with the museum regarding relevant guests to invite.

## 3. Public events
Two public events are planned during the period:
### 3.1. Opening event: Tuesday 30 October 2012, 18.00-19.00
To start the process at the Museum of Architecture on the project's first public day, an event that announces the concept of "The Public Office" and the project at the museum, will be organized. The intention with the event is to contextualize the project historically and politically, for example through a lecture on public places throughout history, and by discussing the topics we intend to work with during the project period. Further, we wish to contextualize the project within The Museum of Architecture's work on sustainable development. The content of the evening will be developed in dialogue between Dilettant AB and The Museum of Architecture.

### 3.2. Finishing event, organized by the end of the period at The Swedish Museum of Architecture
At the end of the period, under the theme "Political dimensions", we plan to organize a final public event. Theme and form is not yet fixed, but one proposal is to invite politicians from the relevant policy areas to discuss The Public Office as a political vision.

## 4. The Public Office – a part of the EU project Special Issue 
The second part of The Public Office project is invited to be a part of the EU project Special Issue, initiated and coordinated by Les Laboratoires d'Auberviliers in Paris, involving additional partners from Spain, Serbia and Turkey. The project focuses on the publication of discursive artistic practices, i.e. how discourses are being made public and shared. From this perspective, The Public Office is a public space where discursive practices and knowledge are made ​​public and has the potential to be shared. The questions further relate to ideas about open source, commons and publicness, which will be discussed under the subject heading “Sustainable development”.
A group of approximately six people from the Special Issue project partners will participate in the work at the Museum of Architecture during the period November 12 to 17.

## 5. Web and communication	
A web platform will be constructed for the project period at the Museum of Architecture. The aim is to promote the project at the Museum of Architecture as well as promoting the concept of The Public Office through dynamic information that is developed and expanded as the project progresses. It will also serve as a workspace for project team's research work and a potential surface for publishing feeds of the users' activities to promote interaction and community in and beyond the project space.

In addition to the digital communication, press work and targeted invitations to organizations, networks and user groups who might be interested in working in the Public Office of the Museum of Architecture, will be conducted. A separate marketing plan will be established by Dilettant AB, in dialogue with the museum.

## 6. Comment on the Hybris Konstproduktion AB name change
Since the projects of Hybris Konstproduktion AB have gradually moved towards new and broader fields than art and culture, the company's board of directors have decided to change the company name to Dilettant AB. The goal is that the new name should be in place before publishing The Public Office at the Museum of Architecture, which means that the name Hybris Konstproduktion AB should be replaced by Dilettant AB as soon as the Swedish Companies Registration Office has given its approval for the name change. We estimate that this process will be completed by 1 October 2012 and will keep all stakeholders informed about the process.

## 7. Appendix
A revised budget is attached to this project plan.
