# Protocol Dialogue meeting #3
  
## Guests: Elisabeth Aldstedt (områdeschef stadsdelsbiblioteken) & Giovanna Jörgenssen 
### Stockholm City Library 
From The Public Office: Anders Jacobson & Myriam Mazzoni    
  
### The current situation for the public city libraries

There are today 40 city neigborhood libraries (stadsdelsbibliotek) in Stockholm, and they all have different age and standard. There is currently a strong political engagement for the libraries – new money is granted for building new libraries and to renovate old ones, and guidelines are given to expand the library concept. The libraries are very well used and visited, which also means that a lot of them are quite run down. The amount of visitors is stable, but the user groups are getting more narrow. The library as an institution are in a time of transition, in reaction to the increasing availibility of information online, as well as cheap books for sale – both on and offline.

The organization is looking for new concepts and contexts. They need to become even more availible and relevant, and they need to find ways to give people reasons to visit the library beyond the traditional function of giving information. In this process the organization wants to collaborate with other partners – it is claimed to be a rather introvert organization with weak potential for development.

### What is going on right now?
Elisabeth Aldstedt & Giovanna Jörgenssen are working on investigating the possibilities and frames for building new libraries in Liljeholmen, Gullmarsplan, Norra Djurgårdsstaden and Kista. Furthermore, several of the existing libraries will be renovated, but it it still unclear which of them. 

The main focus is currently on the new library in Liljeholmen. There is yet no time plan or frames for the project, and the organization is free to brainstorm and experiment for possible future functions, forms and collaborations.

### Work places and libraries?
Open workplaces is an idea that has been identified and discussed in this work. Already today people are using the libraries to work and study, but in a rather unclear way – how and where in the library spaces can this happen in the best ways? The library is a goldmine with access to information and meetings, and is thus very functional as a workplace. But analysis on how the spaces are actually used is still lacking and this use of space should be clarified. 

The libraries have lost their ”Google function”, and have to develop complementary activities and services in parallel to the core activities around books. The Public Office could definitely be something to try out in this context. The concept would provide a suitable frame to facilitate the need that is already becoming increasingly visble in the library.

### Further thoughts on possible libraries/projects to connect to for try-out
* Liljeholmen; how would it be to build a library for the temporary visitor? In connection to or in collaboration with the new hotel, the shopping centre etc. In the hotel lobby?
* The Högdalen library has over dimensioned staff spaces that could possibly be renovated/reorganized and used better.
* A current initiative that could be interesting from a different point of view is Tellus in Hornstull, a library with special functions and activities for elderly and disabled.

### Further things to think about
* It is crucial that everyone feels welcome, and there is a risk about the library – it shouldn’t become a place where people expect too much help. It has to be clear that the visitor is independent in her/his activities.    
* Continue to clarify the significant features of PO – ideologically as well as spacially. What is supposed to happen there? What is required in order to create the right atmosphere and approach?
* Keep formulating the differences from Coffice, kafés etc. 
* If Liljeholmen – what kind of populations live there, and what are the movements?

### Reactions to The Public Office Concept
* ”PO is an interesting concept for us to think more about, it is very much in line with our ambitions for development”
* Dilettant could host a workshop and/or presentation about PO for the library staff, in relation to their visionary work about the renovation process
* ”You shouldn’t be scared of emphasizing the ideology of the concept – what is negotiable and not? What are the frames in order to avoid emptying or misusing the concept?”

### To Do – next step
* Dilettant will contact Elisabeth Aldstedt & Giovanna Jörgenssen when POMA is done!
