### Design of the space
We will compile ideas, proposals, questions, and set up a number of meetings with Magnus, for brainstorming and tips. We discussed involving students, companies etc.

### Opening event
Sandra said that the museum are planning to host an event focusing on Pulicness (Allmänningar), and proposed that we do the event together with that as a theme. We were/are very positive to that idea – to have POMA introduced as part of a bigger issue/movement. This will also attract a larger/different crowd than if the whole event focuses on POMA. Our team and Sandra will brainstorm some ideas and Johan will get back to her about a meeting soon.

### Arkitekturmuseet turns 50
10-11 November there will be birthday celebrations at the museum. We should know about this and discuss whether or not we would like to interact/use that event/crowd somehow. The main hoolabaloo will be on the Saturday.

### Project Plan and contract
We looked through their contract proposal and it looks fine. Johan will finish it and send it to Monica, and then send the invoice. We have to complete the plan with a Marketing plan, which should be dialogued with Mara Ö. 

### hallbarstad.se
The museum is running a website – http://hallbarstad.se/ – Sustainable City, which we should check out. They will put info about POMA there.
