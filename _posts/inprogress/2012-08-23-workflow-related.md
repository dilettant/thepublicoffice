## Assertions

* We will use issues as
	* To-dos
    * Forum/discussions
* Milestones in the issues section as milestones/deadlines
* Project's main repository as the main web page hosting
* Wiki directory inside the main repository to publish our notes etc (should this be renamed to something else than wiki?)

### Assets

* All the files that we want to be able to display on the website will go inside the github folder, when we don't need to then we keep them in the shared dropbox folder.
* look into some javascript plugin to replace audio and video links with embed codes
