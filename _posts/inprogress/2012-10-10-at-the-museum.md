# Public office
## At the museum of architecture

### Intro
Are you working or studying in your home, in cafes or libraries? Do you long for a workplace and community to work with others? A open and free site to share ideas, have meetings and support each other at work?

### What we have
At the museum we have space for 20 or 30 people to work, but please make sure you contact us before coming in order to make sure there will be room for you.
You will find basic office equipment such as printer, scanner and copier. We beleive that by sharing what you know or asking for help we often end up with better results, so we will try aswell to facilitate tools for you to interact and exchange your work with others if you whish to do so.

### What you need
You will have to bring your own tools here, your latop, mouse, tablet etc…
We also ask you to keep in mind that everyone should be able to work in the Public office.  This means that  meetings with large groups who need to use the entire space can be difficult. However, there are additional nearby spaces for  meetings and lectures that can be booked.

### Rules
Together we will find a good way and sound level, the ways to interact, and make adjustments as the project progresses.

If you have specific questions about whether your type of work is  possible at The Public Office, or if you want to make sure the space is not full – give us a call!
