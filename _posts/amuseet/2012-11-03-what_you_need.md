You will have to bring your own work tools; your laptop, tablet, paper and pen etc. We also ask you to keep in mind that everyone should be able to work in The Public Office. Together we will create a good environment for co-working and try out different ways to interact.  If you have specific questions about whether your type of work is possible at The Public Office, or if you want to make sure the space is not full – give us a call!
