#### New Commons – what is public today?
New times have changed the conditions for what we perceive as common. How have perceptions of, and use of, public environments changed in the recent decades? What function could public offices fill?

Talks by Karin Bradley (Department of Urban Planning and Environment, KTH) , Monica Fundin Pourshahidi (The Swedish Museum of Architecture) and Dilettant, who will present The Public Office project and introduce the space. Mingle, snacks and alcohol-free drinks – welcome!
