The Public Office at The Swedish Museum of Architecture in Stockholm, 30 Oct-30 Nov 2012, is part of a long term development project, that aims to articulate an idea of open and rent-free work and meeting places, where the public is given the opportunity to engage in work and further education.  
The foundation of the idea is the creation of free and democratically available structures for work, where people's time and competences can be shared and enrich each other.
