The Public Office at the Museum of Architecture is open Tuesday-Saturday at 10.00-18.00, 30 October-30 November. The office has space for 20-30 people to work, and basic office equipment such as wireless internet, printer, scanner and copier. The project team is here to introduce you to the space and its functions.

There are additional nearby spaces for meetings and lectures that can be booked, so let us know if you would like to organize something that might not fit in the office space. Next to the office there is also a nice café.
