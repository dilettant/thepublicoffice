In order to situate the project's ambitions and driving forces, we introduce a number of basic ideological standpoints, which nurture the work with The Public Office concept.

## Cooperation {#cooperation}

We believe that through cooperative approaches and strategies, we can achieve a more sustainable society. The sharing of resources and knowledge leads to a more efficient, productive and sustainable use of resources. Cooperative approaches have great potential to nurture social and political participation, knowledge and community. The Public Office is rooted in an approach of cooperation and sharing – of infrastructure, tools and knowledge.

## Commons {#commons}

We believe that social and economic infrastructure that is a prerequisite for equality and democracy should be provided by the public sector. Integration and equality is promoted when people are given equal conditions and opportunities to move, work, meet, access information, healthcare and education. We therefore argue that equal opportunity to work communality and knowledge should be supported by the public sector.

## Diversity {#diversity}

To enable social diversity, many different types of specific activities and locations must be encouraged, rather than searching for a generic style "one-size-fits-all". We therefore propose that Public Offices – its different forms, structures and approaches – should be based in local and context specific needs, opportunities and initiatives.

## Open Source {#open_source}

The Public Office is an Open Source initiative. This means that all ideas, methods and material produced or compiled during the project, is available for everyone to use, because we believe that shared knowledge can enhance people powered change and collaborative processes. 

It also means that everyone can contribute. You can send feedback about the concept, advise on research that could help develop the ideas, or spread the word. 

The project's digital tools, such as this website, is built on Open Source code and hosted on GitHub, but we also wish to promote and practice the Open Source philosophy beyond the digital realm.
