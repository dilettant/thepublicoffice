We believe that social and economic infrastructure that is a prerequisite for equality and democracy should be provided by the public sector. Integration and equality is promoted when people are given equal conditions and opportunities to move, work, meet, access information, healthcare and education. We therefore argue that equal opportunity to work communality and knowledge should be supported by the public sector.
