The second and current phase aims to open up the research process and to practically try out the concept of a Public Office. Between 30 October–30 November 2012, a temporary Public Office will be open at The Swedish Museum of Architecture in Stockholm. Those who come to use the office are welcome to work independently or in groups, study, organize lectures, conversations, exchange ideas, make contacts and so on.  

The project team consists of Anders Jacobson, Myriam Mazzoni, Victor Saiz & Johan Thelander. Throughout the period, the team will continue developing the concept of public offices, along with invited guests and interested users. Starting from three main topics – *Work*, *Sustainable development*, and *Political dimensions* – we invite politicians and civil servants, researchers, architects, city planners, artists and representatives of libraries and housing companies, to critically explore the concept's potential and political viability.  

The Public Office, Phase II, is run by Dilettant AB in collaboration with The Swedish Museum of Architecture, the EU project Special Issue and Fabel Kommunikation AB, with financial support from the Culture Programme of the European Union, Kulturbryggan, The Swedish Museum of Architecture and the City of Stockholm.  

The project is part of the EU project [Special Issue](http://specialissue.eu), with partners in France, Serbia, Spain and Turkey. Special Issue focuses on the publication of discursive practices in the arts sector, and is coordinated by Les Laboratoires d'Aubervillier, Paris.
