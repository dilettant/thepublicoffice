The idea of The Public Office has developed in different forms and articulations since 2006. In 2011, the concept was formulated and launched in the form of a long-term research project.   

In this section you can read more about the forms, collaborators and funders of the different project phases.

## Phase I {#phase_i}

The Public Office, Phase I, was initiated and managed by Anders Jacobson and Johan Thelander, of Dilettant AB. Meetings were held with a number of actors in the fields of cultural policy, public administration, urban development and architecture. Further discussions with artists, entrepreneurs, academics and students have taken place in open contexts, such as workshops and festivals. The resulting project report constitutes the basis for further work on the concept.  

Project duration: 1 November 2011 – 1 June 2012

## Phase II {#phase_ii}

Phase II took place in autumn 2012 in collaboration with The Swedish Museum of Architecture, the EU project Special Issue, Offecct AB and Fabel Kommunikation AB. The project team consisted of Anders Jacobson, Myriam Mazzoni, Victor Saiz & Johan Thelander. The office was designed by Marie de France, Anna Ingebrigtsen and Sam Kennedy, and the project graphic design was done by Alba Plaza.

In the second phase, we opened up the process by hosting a temporary Public Office at the Museum of Architecture for five weeks, and by inviting key stakeholders to dialogue meetings around the idea. For example, we met:

* Karin Bradley, assistant professor at Dep. for Urban & Regional Studies, KTH
* Charlotta Mellander, professor of economics
* Faaid Ali-Nuur Ahmed, Förorternas Riksdag (Forix)
* Madeleine Sjöstedt (fp), mayor of culture and real estate, Stockholm
* Berit Högberg (s), member of parliament
* Ann-Margarethe Livh (v), group leader Stockholm
* Åsa Jernberg (mp), group leader Stockholm
* Roland Paulsen, PhD of sociology
* Patrik Liljegren, Stockholm Culture Department
* Elisabeth Aldstedt & Giovanna Jörgenssen, Stockholms Stadsbibliotek
* Niklas Svensson, strategist for city development.

236 unique users came to work in the office during these five weeks, and a further 130 people came to learn more about the idea. The Public Office space and concept was met with great curiosity from disparate actors who took an active interest in starting up Public Offices in the future.

Delmoment II was supported by the Culture Programme of the European Union, Kulturbryggan, The Swedish Museum of Architecture and the City of Stockholm, and was a part of the EU project [Special Issue](http://specialissue.eu), with partners in France, Serbia, Spain and Turkey.

## Phase III {#phase_iii}

The Public Office is an Open Source initiative, which means that one of the goals is that Public Offices should be initiated, jointly owned, operated and modified by local actors on their own initiative. To clarify the conditions under which this can be done, we must, like other Open Source initiative clarify this in a kind of "license", where clear guidelines and terms of use are articulated to provide support, experience and framework for initiators.

Phase III is currently under development and will result in applicable and evaluable guidelines and terms of use for starting local public offices in different forms, and a plan for collaboration on concrete testing activities in conjunction with the Stockholm City Library.

Phase III will primarily be conducted in the form of dialogue meetings, interviews, workshops, lectures (two of which will be public), field trips, literature and text production. The results will be made ​​available in digital and printed form.
