The idea of The Public Office has developed in different forms and articulations since 2006. In 2011, the concept was formulated and launched in the form of a long-term research project.   

In this section you can read more about the forms, collaborators and funders of the different project phases.

## Phase I {#phase_i}

The Public Office, Phase I, was initiated and managed by Anders Jacobson and Johan Thelander, of Dilettant AB. Meetings were held with a number of actors in the fields of cultural policy, public administration, urban development and architecture. Further discussions with artists, entrepreneurs, academics and students have taken place in open contexts, such as workshops and festivals. The resulting project report constitutes the basis for further work on the concept.  

Project duration: 1 November 2011 – 1 June 2012

## Phase II {#phase_ii}

The second and current phase aims to open up the research process and to practically try out the concept of a Public Office. Between 30 October–30 November 2012, a temporary Public Office will be open at The Swedish Museum of Architecture in Stockholm. Those who come to use the office are welcome to work independently or in groups, study, organize lectures, conversations, exchange ideas, make contacts and so on.  

The project team consists of Anders Jacobson, Myriam Mazzoni, Victor Saiz & Johan Thelander. Throughout the period, the team will continue developing the concept of public offices, along with invited guests and interested users. Starting from three main topics – *Work*, *Sustainable development*, and *Political dimensions* – we invite politicians and civil servants, researchers, architects, city planners, artists and representatives of libraries and housing companies, to critically explore the concept's potential and political viability.  

The Public Office, Phase II, is run by Dilettant AB in collaboration with The Swedish Museum of Architecture, the EU project Special Issue and Fabel Kommunikation AB, with financial support from the Culture Programme of the European Union, Kulturbryggan, The Swedish Museum of Architecture and the City of Stockholm.  

The project is part of the EU project [Special Issue](http://specialissue.eu), with partners in France, Serbia, Spain and Turkey. Special Issue focuses on the publication of discursive practices in the arts sector, and is coordinated by Les Laboratoires d'Aubervillier, Paris.

## Phase III {#phase_iii}

The Public Office is an Open Source initiative, which means that one of the goals is that public offices should be initiated, jointly owned, operated and modified by local actors on their own initiative. To clarify the conditions under which this can be done, we must, like other Open Source initiative clarify this in a kind of "license", where clear guidelines and terms of use are articulated to provide support, experience and framework for initiators.

Phase III is currently under development and will result in applicable and evaluable guidelines and terms of use for starting local public offices in different forms, and a plan for collaboration on concrete testing activities in conjunction with the Stockholm City Library.

Module III will primarily be conducted in the form of dialogue meetings, interviews, workshops, lectures (two of which will be public), field trips, literature and text production. The results will be made ​​available in digital and printed form.
