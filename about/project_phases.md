The idea of The Public Office has developed in different forms and articulations since 2006. In 2011, the concept was formulated and launched in the form of a long-term research project.   

In this section you can read more about the forms, collaborators and funders of the different project phases.

## Phase I {#phase_i}

The Public Office, Phase I, was managed by Anders Jacobson and Johan Thelander – Dilettant AB. Meetings were held with a number of key stakeholders in the fields of cultural policy, public administration, urban development and architecture. Further discussions with artists, entrepreneurs, academics and students have taken place in open contexts such as workshops and festivals. The resulting project report has constituted the basis for further work on the concept.  

Project duration: 1 November 2011 – 1 June 2012

## Phase II {#phase_ii}

The Public Office, Phase II, was managed by project team consisted of Anders Jacobson, Myriam Mazzoni, Victor Saiz & Johan Thelander. The office was designed by Marie de France, Anna Ingebrigtsen and Sam Kennedy, and the graphic design was done by Alba Plaza. The project was realized in collaboration with The Swedish Museum of Architecture, the EU project Special Issue, Offecct AB and Fabel Kommunikation AB.

In the second phase, we opened up the process by hosting a temporary Public Office at The Swedish Museum of Architecture for five weeks (30 October – 30 Novermber), and by inviting key stakeholders to dialogue meetings around the idea. 

More than two hundred people came to use the public office during the five weeks it was open, and a further 130 people came to learn more about the idea.

Delmoment II was supported by the Culture Programme of the European Union, Kulturbryggan, The Swedish Museum of Architecture and the City of Stockholm, and was a part of the EU project [Special Issue](http://specialissue.eu), with partners in France, Serbia, Spain and Turkey. 

Project duration: 1 June 2012 – 28 February 2013

## Phase III {#phase_iii}
Phase III is carried out in cooperation with Stockholm Public Library, within the frames of a new "Learning Center" in the suburb of Hässelby gård. The space, which will open in 2014, will include a library, culture school for youth, unemployment services and civic service. During the project period, we will identify the conditions and opportunities of The Public Office within the Learning Center, as well as make applications for a more long-term financing to realize a try-out period in Hässelby gård.

Project duration: 22 November-31 December, 2013
