The Public Office is an Open Source initiative. This means that all ideas, methods and material produced or compiled during the project, is available for everyone to use, because we believe that shared knowledge can enhance people powered change and collaborative processes. 

It also means that everyone can contribute; by taking part of the project you are involved in developing it. You can also send feedback about the concept or advise on research that could help develop the ideas. 

The project's digital tools, such as this website, is built on Open Source code, via the platform GitHub â€“ but we also wish to promote and practice the Open Source philosophy beyond the digital realm.
