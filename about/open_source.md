The Public Office is an Open Source initiative. This means that all ideas, methods and material produced or compiled during the project, is available for everyone to use, because we believe that shared knowledge can enhance people powered change and collaborative processes. 

It also means that everyone can contribute. You can send feedback about the concept, advise on research that could help develop the ideas, or spread the word. 

The project's digital tools, such as this website, is built on Open Source code and hosted on GitHub, but we also wish to promote and practice the Open Source philosophy beyond the digital realm.
