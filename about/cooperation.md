We believe that through cooperative approaches and strategies, we can achieve a more sustainable society. The sharing of resources and knowledge leads to a more efficient, productive and sustainable use of resources. Cooperative approaches have great potential to nurture social and political participation, knowledge and community. The Public Office is rooted in an approach of cooperation and sharing – of infrastructure, tools and knowledge.
