The second phase aims to open up the research prosess and to practically try out the concept. A temporary Public Office is opened 30 October–30 November 2012, in cooperation with the The Swedish Museum of  Architecture in Stockholm. During five weeks, a project space in the museum will function as a public office. The room is thus open to the public, and those who come to use the office are welcome to work independently or in groups, study, organize lectures, conversations, exchange ideas, make contacts and so on.  

The project team consists of Anders Jacobson, Myriam Mazzoni, Victor Saiz & Johan Thelander. The site becomes a base for our further work on the concept of public offices, along with invited guests and interested users. Starting from three main topics – Work, Sustainable development, and Political dimensions – we invite politicians and civil servants, researchers, architects, city planners, artists and representatives of libraries and housing companies to critically explore the concept's potential and political viability.
