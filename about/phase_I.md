The Public Office, Phase I, was initiated and managed by Anders Jacobson and Johan Thelander, of Dilettant AB. Meetings were held with a number of actors in the fields of cultural policy, public administration, urban development and architecture. Further discussions with artists, entrepreneurs, academics and students have taken place in open contexts, such as workshops and festivals. The resulting project report constitutes the basis for further work on the concept.
