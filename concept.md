This section is where we continuously develop the concept of The Public Office. The material is based on the report generated by the project Phase I (released 1 June 2012).   

On the concept pages we aim to situate the idea in a political framework, discuss it in relation to social issues such as public meeting places and changes in the labour market. This is also where we develop proposals and arguments on how public offices can be initiated, managed and financed.
