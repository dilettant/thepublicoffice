This section is where we continuously develop the concept of The Public Office. The material is based on the report generated by the project Phase I (Spring 2012). On the concept pages we aim to situate the idea in a political framework, discuss it in relation to social issues such as public meeting places and changes in the labour market. This is also where we develop proposals on how public offices can be run, owned and financed.   

If you are a nerd, and interested in following the editing and updating of the concept, contact us and we'll give you access.
