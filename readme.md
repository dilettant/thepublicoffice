# The Public Office

The Public Office is a long-term development project initiated by Dilettante AB. The project seeks to articulate an idea of open and rent-free work and meeting places where people are given the opportunity to engage in work and education.

We use GitHub as a platform for the project's website and some of our internal communications. By opening an account on GitHub, you can easily edit and suggest changes to all web-based text material.
