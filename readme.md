# Public offices

From the website:
> "Public offices" is a long-term development project that seeks to articulate an idea of open and rent-free work and meeting places. During several project stages, we will explore the concept's possibilities and potential functions in an increasingly mobile labor market, as well as in urban planning and local community development, business development and integration.

## To-do

1. Take a final decision on time period that the Public Office will take place at the museum.
2. Monica asked us to consider the possibility to use part of the project time to elaborate on the PO's relation to the following topics (in regards of their exhibition about food):
	* From citizens to consumers
	* Consumption patterns
	* Public/private
3. Discuss how to furnish the space at the museum
	* invite a company to do it, eg. a second hand office furniture or similiar
	* collect what we can find at the museum or similar
