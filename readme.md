# Public offices

From the website:
> "Public offices" is a long-term development project that seeks to articulate an idea of open and rent-free work and meeting places. During several project stages, we will explore the concept's possibilities and potential functions in an increasingly mobile labor market, as well as in urban planning and local community development, business development and integration.

## Notes from meeting with Monica Pourshahidi

### The PO-space at the museum
* We have a new space where the Public Office will take place, see [Pic-1](https://github.com/dilettant/public-offices/blob/master/120627%20Museum%20space%20AK%201.jpg), [Pic-2](https://github.com/dilettant/public-offices/blob/master/120627%20Museum%20space%20AK%202.jpg),  [Pic-3](https://github.com/dilettant/public-offices/blob/master/120627%20Museum%20space%20AK%203.jpg).

### Schedual
* Current proposed dates for the Public Office to be realized at The Swedish Museum of Architecture is 30 October till 30 of November (five weeks in total)

### Communcation
Our contact person at the museum is Maria Östman, responsable for marketing and communication 
* 	Monica informed that the museum has rather poor resources to help with marketing but will help as much as they possibly can
* Johan proposed that the AK-project team deliver all information in formats that are convenient for the museum

### Documentation
* Monica said that the museum will ask their photographer to come by one day to take photos
* Johan described current thoughts about the documentation, i.e. collect a lot of text and photos during the entire opening weeks of the project and then use the material to publish a bigger bulk of information. Primarily as a web site, from which material can be collected in the form of a project report that can be sent to funders and similar.

### To-do
1. Take a final decision on time period that the Public Office will take place at the museum.
2. Monica asked us to consider the possibility to use part of the project time to elaborate on the PO's relation to the following topics (in regards of their exhibition about food):
	* From citizens to consumers
	* Consumption patterns
	* Public/private
3. Discuss how to furnish the space at the museum
	* invite a company to do it, eg. a second hand office furniture or similiar
	* collect what we can find at the museum or similar
4. Contact Maria Östman regarding marketing strategies and preliminary schedule of the museum
