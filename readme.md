# Public offices

From the website:
> "Public offices" is a long-term development project that seeks to articulate an idea of open and rent-free work and meeting places. During several project stages, we will explore the concept's possibilities and potential functions in an increasingly mobile labor market, as well as in urban planning and local community development, business development and integration.

## Notes from meeting with Monica Pourshahidi

### The space
* we have a new space to realize the project in, see files 120627 Museum space AK 1, 2, 3
* we need to figure out how to furnish the space, possibly to invite a compnany that is suitable for such, or collect what we can find

### Marketing
Our contact person at the museum is Maria Östman, responsable for marketing and communication 
* 	Monica informed that the museum has rather poor resources to help with marketing but will help as much as they possibly can
* Johan proposed that the AK-project team deliver all information in formats that are convenient for the museum

### Schedual
* Current proposed dates for the Public Office to be realized at The Swedish Museum of Architecture is 30 October till 30 of November (five weeks in total)
* We should contact Maria Östman to send us the preliminary schedule of the museum

### Documentation
* Motica proposed that the museum will ask their photographer to come by one day to take photos
* Johan described current thoughts about the documentation, i.e. collect a lot of text and photos during the entire opening weeks of the project and then use the material to publish a bigger bulk of information. Primarily as a web site, but also collected in the form of a project report that can be sent to all funders and similar.

### Questions
* Monica asked us to consider the possibility to use part of the project time to elaborate on the AK's relation to the following topics (in regards of their exhibition about food)
	* From citizens to consumers
	* Consumption patterns
	* Public/private
