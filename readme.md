# The Public Office

The Public Office" is a long-term development project that seeks to articulate an idea of open and rent-free work and meeting places. During several project stages, we will explore the concept's possibilities and potential functions in an increasingly mobile labor market, as well as in urban planning and local community development, business development and integration.  

Please refer to this [english version of the docs](http://prose.io/#dilettant/thepublicoffice/blob/master/files/PublicOffices.md) for a more extended explanation.
