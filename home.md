The Public Office is a vision if open and rent-free meeting places where people can engage in self-organized activities, work and education. The idea is that these local public spaces can contribute to local development and social engagement, and constitute meeting places for students, youth, seniors and non-profit groups, as well as for freelancers, precarious workers, small businesses and unemployed.
