*Are you working or studying at home, in cafes or libraries? Do you long for a workplace and community where you can work side by side with others? An open and free site to share ideas, have meetings and support each other at work?*

If so, we propose you to bring your work to the temporary public office at the Swedish Museum of Architecture in Stockholm.
