### The Public Office is a long-term development project that seeks to articulate an idea of open and rent-free work and meeting places.   

During several project phases, we explore the concept's possibilities and potential functions in an increasingly mobile labor market, as well as in urban planning and local community development, business development and integration.

This site is where we develop and share the research of the concept. Feel free to contact us, and to contribute by sending feedback and comments, reporting bugs, and by spreading the word.
